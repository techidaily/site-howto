This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Samsung Galaxy M34 5G. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy M34 5G reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.</p><p>The further away the Samsung Galaxy M34 5G devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.</p><h3 id="2-9-Avoid-interference-of-other-Bluetooth-sources"><a href="#2-9-Avoid-interference-of-other-Bluetooth-sources" class="headerlink" title="2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources"></a>2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg"                      alt="android bluetooth problems - avoid interference"                ></p><p>The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.</p><p>With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.</p><p>To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G to the Samsung Galaxy M34 5G device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/proven-ways-to-fix-there-was-a-problem-parsing-the-package-on-vivo-t2-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Proven Ways to Fix There Was A Problem Parsing the Package on Vivo T2 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-android-system-webview-crash-2024-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra Android System Webview Crash 2024 Issue | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/7-solutions-to-fix-chrome-crashes-or-wont-open-on-samsung-galaxy-f54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>7 Solutions to Fix Chrome Crashes or Wont Open on Samsung Galaxy F54 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-solve-youtube-app-crashing-on-itel-a05s-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Solutions to Solve YouTube App Crashing on Itel A05s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/infinix-smart-8-stuck-on-screen-finding-solutions-for-stuck-on-boot-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Infinix Smart 8 Stuck on Screen – Finding Solutions For Stuck on Boot | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/11-ways-to-fix-it-when-my-xiaomi-14-pro-wont-charge-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>11 Ways to Fix it When My Xiaomi 14 Pro Wont Charge | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-an-unresponsive-nubia-red-magic-9-pro-screen-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Troubleshooting Guide How to Fix an Unresponsive Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro Screen | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-the-best-free-video-compression-tools-for-ios-devices-for-2024/"><u>New The Best Free Video Compression Tools for iOS Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/the-best-android-sim-unlock-code-generators-unlock-your-samsung-galaxy-a05-phone-hassle-free-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Best Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Unlock Your Samsung Galaxy A05 Phone Hassle-Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-sustainable-practices-greening-urban-landscapes/"><u>2024 Approved  Sustainable Practices  Greening Urban Landscapes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-online-image-size-converter-8-trustworthy-options/"><u>New In 2024, Online Image Size Converter 8 Trustworthy Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-transforming-passive-browsing-into-active-participation-on-fb/"><u>[New] Transforming Passive Browsing Into Active Participation on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-conquering-instagrams-video-challenges-head-on-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Conquering Instagram's Video Challenges Head-On for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-vivo-t2x-5g-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Vivo T2x 5G Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-fixes-how-to-recover-forgotten-icloud-password-on-your-apple-iphone-xs-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Easy Fixes How To Recover Forgotten iCloud Password On your Apple iPhone XS</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It will be ironic if that device, supposed to grant convenience, provides problems instead. Some people face this when their <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and unable to do anything. As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-12-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-12-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Realme 12 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Realme 12 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Realme 12 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Realme 12 5G functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Realme 12 5G, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Realme 12 5G when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Realme 12 5G to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Realme 12 5G device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Realme 12 5G to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Realme 12 5G could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Realme 12 5G:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Android Phone Stuck On Boot Screen"></a>Part 3.

It will be ironic if that device, supposed to grant convenience, provides problems instead. Some people face this when their <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and unable to do anything. As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-10T-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-10T-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Realme 10T 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Realme 10T 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Realme 10T 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Realme 10T 5G functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Realme 10T 5G, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Realme 10T 5G when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Realme 10T 5G to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Realme 10T 5G device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Realme 10T 5G to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Realme 10T 5G could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Realme 10T 5G:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your Realme 10T 5G and choose “Apps &amp; Notifications”&#x2F;”Apps”&#x2F;”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).</li><li>In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.</li><li>Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - clear cache"                ></p><p>Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”.

RAM, if at the increased level, is responsible for the Realme 10T 5G device’s freezing, poor performance, and most probably is the reason behind crashing Settings. Also, if the apps in the background keep running, they might conflict with the Settings and stop it to perform properly. Therefore clearing RAM is important when Android Settings is not responding. Here is how to do it.</p><ol><li>Firstly, you need to go to the Recent apps screen. For this, long-press the Home key.<br> Note: Please note that different devices have different ways to go to the Recent apps screen. Do it according to the Realme 10T 5G device you own.</li><li>Now, swipe the apps and tap on the clear option. You will be able to notice the amount of RAM cleared</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-ram.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - clear ram"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Uninstall-the-Google-update"><a href="#Part-3-Uninstall-the-Google-update" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Uninstall the Google update"></a>Part 3: Uninstall the Google update</h2><p>Uninstalling Google Play Store updates has also responded well to many users. It has worked in the case of the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” error. So, we would also like to suggest you use this tip if the others don’t work. Here are the steps to be followed for this.</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your Android and tap on “Application manager” or “Apps” or “Application.</li><li>Now, head to all the apps and select “Google Play Store” from there.</li><li>Tap on “Uninstall Updates” and restart your device to check if the crashing Settings issue has been resolved.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/uninstall-google-update.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - uninstall update"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Uninstall-the-custom-ROM-or-re-flash-the-stock-ROM"><a href="#Part-4-Uninstall-the-custom-ROM-or-re-flash-the-stock-ROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Uninstall the custom ROM or re-flash the stock ROM"></a>Part 4: Uninstall the custom ROM or re-flash the stock ROM</h2><p>Using a custom ROM on your device brings up this problem due to incompatibility or improper installation.

This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Realme GT 3 has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version.

Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem.

Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.</p><ul><li><strong>Out of Wi-Fi Range</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Why does My Realme GT 3 keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi</strong>? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.</p><ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked</strong></li></ul><p>The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.</p><ul><li><strong>Devices Connected with Router</strong></li></ul><p>Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Unstable Internet</strong></li></ul><p>If your Realme GT 3 gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.</p><p>Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects.

Now, press the Power button and hold it for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, select the ‘Reboot’ option to resolve the issue from the options on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-1.jpg"                      alt="select reboot option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings"><a href="#Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Check Router Settings"></a>Fix 2: Check Router Settings</h3><p>If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings.

This could be done easily by following the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on your wifi option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: A list of all the Wi-Fi networks will appear on the screen. Select the network that is causing trouble from that list and hit the ‘Forget Network’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-4.jpg"                      alt="click on forgot network"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: After that, you should reconnect to this Wi-Fi network by selecting it from the Wi-Fi list and entering its password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-5.jpg"                      alt="enter wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router"><a href="#Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Restart Your Router"></a>Fix 4: Restart Your Router</h3><p>As we discussed, to restart your phone, you can also restart the router to get rid of the problem. For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start. If the Realme GT 3 device has no button, disconnect the power supply and plug it back in to connect again. Most internet issues are resolved by restarting the router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-6.jpg"                      alt="restart wifi router"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks"><a href="#Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Forget Old Networks"></a>Fix 5: Forget Old Networks</h3><p>The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Oppo Reno 11F 5G. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Oppo Reno 11F 5G or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Oppo Reno 11F 5G&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Oppo Reno 11F 5G reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Oppo Reno 11F 5G Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.</p><ol start="2"><li>How do you fix a boot loop?</li></ol><p>When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices.

This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg"                      alt="android remove screen protector"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone"><a href="#Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone"></a>Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone</h3><p>A <strong>touchscreen malfunctioning</strong> can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg"                      alt="android dirty screen"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While"><a href="#Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While"></a>Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While</h3><p><strong>Touch problems</strong> also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Restart-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-4-Restart-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Restart Your Android"></a>Method 4: Restart Your Android</h3><p>Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a <strong>touchscreen problem</strong> on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg"                      alt="android restart method"                ></p><p>To restart your Android, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the <strong>Power</strong> button as well as the <strong>Volume Down</strong> button at the same time.</p><h3 id="Method-5-Factory-Data-Reset-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-5-Factory-Data-Reset-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android"></a>Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android</h3><p>Before attempting to have your device checked for any hardware defects, you should try completing a Factory Reset. To do this, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Backup and Reset.</strong> Next, tap on <strong>Factory data reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Delete all</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg"                      alt="android factory data reset"                ></p><p>Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.</p><h3 id="Method-6-Put-Your-Android-into-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#Method-6-Put-Your-Android-into-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode"></a>Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode</h3><p>If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Placing your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong> is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Oppo Reno 11F 5G.</p><p><strong>Step 1A</strong>: Press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button and <strong>Volume Down</strong> buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1B</strong>: If your Oppo Reno 11F 5G still has a <strong>Home</strong> button, press and hold the <strong>Home</strong> button and the <strong>Power</strong> button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1C</strong>: If step 1A did not put your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong>, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 01"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Use the <strong>Volume</strong> buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset, and confirm your choice with the <strong>Power</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 02"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Wait for the process to complete and for your Oppo Reno 11F 5G to restart automatically.</p><h3 id="Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen"><a href="#Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen" class="headerlink" title="Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen"></a>Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen</h3><p>If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the <strong>touchscreen problem,</strong> it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Oppo Reno 11F 5G checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-08.jpg"                      alt="图像"                >“</p><h3 id="Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center"><a href="#Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center" class="headerlink" title="Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center"></a>Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center</h3><p>Your <strong>phone touch problem</strong> might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced.

Does a Cracked Screen Affect Touch on an Android?</h3><p>If you continue using a smartphone with a cracked screen, there are several implications. Your device will be vulnerable to further damage and might develop <strong>touchscreen problems</strong>,and your sensors will gradually begin to malfunction. The capabilities of your device are also compromised the longer you delay repairing it. Moreover, a cracked screen can put your fingers at risk of injury due to potential glass splinters.</p><h3 id="2-How-Do-I-Temporarily-Fix-a-Cracked-Screen"><a href="#2-How-Do-I-Temporarily-Fix-a-Cracked-Screen" class="headerlink" title="2.

This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as OnePlus Ace 2V. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your OnePlus Ace 2V or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your OnePlus Ace 2V&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="OnePlus Ace 2V reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your OnePlus Ace 2V Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on.

For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup.

Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>3,405,439</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article summarizes some of the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.

Here’s how:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Head into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Date &amp; Time</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Ensure that both “**<em>Use network–provided time</em><strong>” and “</strong><em>Use network-provided time zone</em>**” are toggled on.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-11.jpg"                      alt="check date and time settings"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If this doesn’t work, you can try repeating the process and manually setting the time and the time zone.</p></li></ul><p>Once you check or change these settings, try using the Google Play Store app and check whether the issue is fixed. Restarting the phone after changing the settings is also highly advisable.</p><h3 id="9-Troubleshoot-Your-Internet-Connection"><a href="#9-Troubleshoot-Your-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="9. Troubleshoot Your Internet Connection"></a>9. Troubleshoot Your Internet Connection</h3><p>Another regularly overlooked troublemaker is a poor internet connection. That’s because most apps nowadays are meant to work in online mode only, and losing connection or using a bad one interferes with the app’s functionality.</p><p>To test the internet connection on your OnePlus Ace 2V, you should open a browser and head to a random internet page to see if it’s opening and whether there are any delays. If it’s working fine, your internet connection isn’t the problem.</p><h3 id="10-Adjust-Google-Play-Services-Permissions"><a href="#10-Adjust-Google-Play-Services-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="10. Adjust Google Play Services Permissions"></a>10. Adjust Google Play Services Permissions</h3><p>Although permissions rarely change, they can cause issues if you change them accidentally. These settings can be found in the same place where you would uninstall updates or clear the app’s cache, so you can use some of the steps mentioned above to check them.</p><p>Once inside Permission Settings, check whether the Google Play Services and Play Store apps have sufficient permission to do their jobs and whether any required permissions were recently removed. If so, grant these two apps their permissions back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>4,953,228</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although it’s an incredibly frustrating error, the “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped” message is more annoying than serious. We’ve explained why it happens, but we’ve also given you a list of solutions to fix it.</p><p>Our list includes various fixes, from simple ones, like deleting the app’s cache and ensuring your network works fine, to more serious ones, like doing a factory reset. Alternatively, you can do a system repair with the help of Wondershare Dr.Fone, which will certainly fix the problem, but it might be a bit more complicated than cache deletion.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/9-solutions-to-fix-xiaomi-redmi-13c-5g-system-crash-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>9 Solutions to Fix Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G System Crash Issue | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/cellular-network-not-available-for-voice-calls-on-htc-u23-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls On HTC U23 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/cellular-network-not-available-for-voice-calls-on-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls On Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/full-guide-how-to-fix-connection-is-not-private-on-xiaomi-mix-fold-3-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Full Guide How To Fix Connection Is Not Private on Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/4-ways-to-fix-android-blue-screen-of-death-on-vivo-y27-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>4 Ways to Fix Android Blue Screen of Death On Vivo Y27 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/4-solutions-to-fix-unfortunately-your-app-has-stopped-error-on-infinix-hot-40i-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>4 Solutions to Fix Unfortunately Your App Has Stopped Error on Infinix Hot 40i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/play-store-not-working-on-realme-v30-8-solutions-inside-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Play Store Not Working On Realme V30? 8 Solutions Inside | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/play-store-not-working-on-samsung-galaxy-f14-5g-8-solutions-inside-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Play Store Not Working On Samsung Galaxy F14 5G? 8 Solutions Inside | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-soft-bricked-asus-rog-phone-7-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix the Soft Bricked Asus ROG Phone 7? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ultimate-selection-top-rated-montage-anthems/"><u>New 2024 Approved Ultimate Selection Top-Rated Montage Anthems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/ultimate-collection-no-cost-ae-template-gold/"><u>Ultimate Collection  No-Cost AE Template Gold</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-make-your-photos-shine-5-leading-slideshow-software-options-for-2024/"><u>Updated Make Your Photos Shine 5 Leading Slideshow Software Options for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-snap-and-save-your-android-no-price-tag/"><u>[Updated] Snap & Save Your Android - No Price Tag</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/chucklechief-meme-masterclass-online/"><u>ChuckleChief  Meme Masterclass Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/fake-the-location-to-get-around-the-mlb-blackouts-on-tecno-pova-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Fake the Location to Get Around the MLB Blackouts on Tecno Pova 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/transcending-reality-enlightening-metaverse-verses/"><u>Transcending Reality  Enlightening Metaverse Verses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-highest-quality-capture-software-showdown/"><u>In 2024, Highest Quality Capture Software Showdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/in-2024-seamless-video-editing-on-arm-devices-filmora-x-makes-it-happen/"><u>In 2024, Seamless Video Editing on ARM Devices Filmora X Makes It Happen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-comprehensive-review-slomo-video-app-2024-edition/"><u>[New] Comprehensive Review  SloMo Video App - 2024 Edition</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Oppo A2. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Oppo A2 or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Oppo A2&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Oppo A2 reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Oppo A2 Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.</p><ol start="2"><li>How do you fix a boot loop?</li></ol><p>When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.</p><p>For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup. You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.</p><ol start="3"><li>How to prevent a boot loop?</li></ol><p>A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle. Most issues are software-related, such as having to do a system upgrade gone wrong or a problem that doesn’t mesh. One way to prevent this is to perform a software or system upgrade constantly. Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>3,405,439</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article summarizes some of the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.

Why Is Your Sony Xperia 10 V Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Sony Xperia 10 V Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Sony Xperia 10 V has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Sony Xperia 10 V functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Sony Xperia 10 V, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Sony Xperia 10 V when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Sony Xperia 10 V to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Sony Xperia 10 V device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Sony Xperia 10 V to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Sony Xperia 10 V could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option.

As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Samsung Galaxy S24 Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Samsung Galaxy S24 Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Samsung Galaxy S24 has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Samsung Galaxy S24 functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Samsung Galaxy S24, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Samsung Galaxy S24 when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Samsung Galaxy S24 to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Samsung Galaxy S24 device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Samsung Galaxy S24 to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Samsung Galaxy S24 could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Samsung Galaxy S24:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

This error comes in when you have given too many tasks to download.</p><p>Step 1 - To remove that load Just turn your wifi off and then turn your wifi on (the same goes with your cellular data).</p><p>Step 2 - Now after doing this go to your Play Store application and download the application that you were going to download.

What you need to do is clear the cache and clear the data of the play store. This will get rid of the error code 920 the next time you download or update any application from the Google Play store.</p><p>Step 1 – Go to settings of your device.</p><p>Step 2 – Now find “Applications” option under the settings menu. Here you can find “Google Play Store” option. Open it.</p><p>Step 3 – Now, at the bottom, you can find “Clear Cache” option.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Samsung Galaxy S23. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode.

It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Samsung Galaxy S23 or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Samsung Galaxy S23&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy S23 reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Samsung Galaxy S23 Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

We found many Android users have increasingly expressed their frustrations with this recurring problem while browsing on the internet.</p><p>Usually, you can just reload the page to fix the error. But in case it doesn’t help, you may need to look for more advanced solutions. In the following discussion, we will delve into why this <strong>“your connection is not private” on Android</strong> happens and explore solutions that work for you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Addressing-Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Addressing-Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android"></a>Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android</h2><p>First of all, what does <strong>“your connection is not private” on Android</strong> mean? To answer this question, it’s essential to understand that this error is often associated with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol issues.</p><p>SSL is a cryptographic protocol created to establish a secure communication channel over the internet. Its primary purpose is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a user’s device and a website’s server.</p><p>The error message appears when there’s a problem with the SSL&#x2F;TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate of the website you are trying to access. This certificate is a digital document that authenticates the website and encrypts the data transmitted between the user’s device and the server.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Your connection is not private error on Android."                ></p><p>Some common factors that could trigger the <strong>“your connection is not private” on Chrome Android error</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Expired or invalid SSL certificate of the website;</strong></li></ol><p>Certificates are issued for a specific period, and if the website owner fails to renew it in time, your browser will detect it as not secure.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>There is a mismatch between the domain on the certificate and the actual domain you are trying to visit;</strong></li></ol><p>This discrepancy might occur due to a misconfiguration on the website or, in some cases, due to a man-in-the-middle attack where a third party intercepts the communication between your device and the server.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>No HTTPS enforcement;</strong></li></ol><p>Another reason for the issue is if the installed SSL certificate doesn’t turn on the “force HTTPS” option. This means visitors might be using the non-secure HTTP version of the site instead of the safe URL.</p><p>So, the error serves as a warning to users, indicating that the connection may not be secure and sensitive information could be at risk.</p><p>Browsers, including those on Android devices, prioritize user safety and privacy. They will block access to potentially compromised websites to prevent data theft or unauthorized access. That’s why when you get the “your connection is not private” message on Android, you can’t access the website.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-The-Error-Codes-in-“Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private”-Mean"><a href="#Part-2-What-The-Error-Codes-in-“Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private”-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What The Error Codes in “Your Connection Is Not Private” Mean"></a>Part 2: What The Error Codes in “Your Connection Is Not Private” Mean</h2><p>When <strong>“your connection is not private” on Chrome Android error</strong> shows up, it often comes along with specific error codes that can indicate the root cause of the issue. Understanding these error codes is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving the problem effectively.</p><ol><li><strong>ERR_CERT_SYMANTEC_LEGACY: Unsupported Symantec-issued certificate</strong></li></ol><p>This error code indicates that the website you are attempting to access is equipped with an unsupported Symantec-issued certificate. Symantec, a prominent Certificate Authority, had faced concerns about the security of its certificate issuance processes.</p><p>As a result, major browsers, including Google Chrome, no longer support certificates issued by Symantec. If you encounter this error, it implies that the website’s SSL certificate is outdated and needs to be updated with a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID: Unauthenticated SSL certificate</strong></li></ol><p>The presence of this error code suggests that the SSL certificate of the website cannot be authenticated by your browser. This could occur if the certificate is self-signed or issued by an unrecognized Certificate Authority.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID: Date and time mismatch</strong></li></ol><p>This error code points to a discrepancy between your Samsung Galaxy S23’s date and time settings and the information on the website’s SSL certificate, as they have expiration dates. If the date and time settings on your device are incorrect, it may prevent the certificate from being validated. Correcting your device’s date and time settings should resolve this issue.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>SSL certificate error: Generic or unspecified problem</strong></li></ol><p>This is a more generic error message that indicates a problem with the website’s SSL certificate without specifying the exact nature of the issue.

It will be ironic if that device, supposed to grant convenience, provides problems instead. Some people face this when their <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and unable to do anything. As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-11-Pro-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-11-Pro-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Realme 11 Pro+ Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Realme 11 Pro+ Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Realme 11 Pro+ has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Realme 11 Pro+ functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Realme 11 Pro+, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Realme 11 Pro+ when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Realme 11 Pro+ to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Realme 11 Pro+ device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Realme 11 Pro+ to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Realme 11 Pro+ could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Realme 11 Pro+:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Android Phone Stuck On Boot Screen"></a>Part 3.

If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Samsung-Galaxy-F54-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Samsung-Galaxy-F54-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Samsung Galaxy F54 5G device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset.

This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator.

So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today. People only launch the app when they want to take a photo, for everything else there’s a dedicated photo gallery app. What happens when you launch the camera app only to realize it threw an error and you missed your photo moment? Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="camera not working error in android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?"></a>Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G.</p><p><strong>Low Memory</strong></p><p>Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.</p><p><strong>Low Storage</strong></p><p>The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G right where you are, without needing to take the Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera and tap Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache android"                ></p><h3 id="II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache"><a href="#II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache"></a>II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache</h3><p>The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg"                      alt="google play store app updates"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg"                      alt="check for app updates play store"                ></p><p>Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.</p><h3 id="II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down"><a href="#II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down" class="headerlink" title="II.VII: Cool The Phone Down"></a>II.VII: Cool The Phone Down</h3><p>We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.</p><p>If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.</p><h3 id="II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System"><a href="#II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System" class="headerlink" title="II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System"></a>II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System</h3><p>You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.</p><h3 id="II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)"></a>II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)</h3><p>Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as OnePlus 11R. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your OnePlus 11R or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your OnePlus 11R&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="OnePlus 11R reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your OnePlus 11R Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on.

For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.</p><p>For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup. You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.</p><ol start="3"><li>How to prevent a boot loop?</li></ol><p>A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle. Most issues are software-related, such as having to do a system upgrade gone wrong or a problem that doesn’t mesh. One way to prevent this is to perform a software or system upgrade constantly. Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>3,405,439</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article summarizes some of the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.

This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

To fix this problem, plug your smartphone into a charger and wait for your device to turn on again. If it works, then you just prevented a rather annoying experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/how-to-deal-with-the-phone-screen-black-but-still-works-02.jpg"                      alt="drained iphone battery"                ></p><h3 id="App-Troubles"><a href="#App-Troubles" class="headerlink" title="App Troubles"></a>App Troubles</h3><p>If your <strong>phone is working, but the screen is black,</strong> there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application.

As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-11X-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-11X-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Realme 11X 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Realme 11X 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Realme 11X 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Realme 11X 5G functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Realme 11X 5G, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Realme 11X 5G when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Realme 11X 5G to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Realme 11X 5G device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Realme 11X 5G to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Realme 11X 5G could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Realme 11X 5G:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as OnePlus Ace 3. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode.
