Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>.

Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Poco M6 5G devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:</p><ul><li><strong>Router Problems</strong></li></ul><p>If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.</p><ul><li><strong>Out of Wi-Fi Range</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Why does My Poco M6 5G keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi</strong>? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.</p><ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked</strong></li></ul><p>The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.</p><ul><li><strong>Devices Connected with Router</strong></li></ul><p>Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Unstable Internet</strong></li></ul><p>If your Poco M6 5G gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.</p><p>Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone"></a>Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone</h2><p>As we have mentioned earlier if your Wi-Fi is stable, but it keeps disconnecting from <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s22.html" >Poco M6 5G S22 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or other Android phones, the coming section of this article is for you.

Sometimes, it’s the phone that’s causing a problem, so to resolve it, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Firstly, unlock your phone. Now, press the Power button and hold it for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, select the ‘Reboot’ option to resolve the issue from the options on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-1.jpg"                      alt="select reboot option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings"><a href="#Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Check Router Settings"></a>Fix 2: Check Router Settings</h3><p>If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings. This is because your phone might be blocked from connecting to the network, and if this is the scenario, your phone will never maintain the connection. You should check the Router’s admin panel or app to remove your phone from the blocklist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-2.jpg"                      alt="check router settings"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reconnect-to-Network"><a href="#Fix-3-Reconnect-to-Network" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reconnect to Network"></a>Fix 3: Reconnect to Network</h3><p>To fix the annoying problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting, you should try forgetting the network and then reconnecting to it. This could be done easily by following the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on your wifi option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: A list of all the Wi-Fi networks will appear on the screen. Select the network that is causing trouble from that list and hit the ‘Forget Network’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-4.jpg"                      alt="click on forgot network"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: After that, you should reconnect to this Wi-Fi network by selecting it from the Wi-Fi list and entering its password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-5.jpg"                      alt="enter wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router"><a href="#Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Restart Your Router"></a>Fix 4: Restart Your Router</h3><p>As we discussed, to restart your phone, you can also restart the router to get rid of the problem. For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start. If the Poco M6 5G device has no button, disconnect the power supply and plug it back in to connect again. Most internet issues are resolved by restarting the router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-6.jpg"                      alt="restart wifi router"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks"><a href="#Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Forget Old Networks"></a>Fix 5: Forget Old Networks</h3><p>The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-7.jpg"                      alt="open wifi settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You will see a list of all the Wi-Fi networks you have connected to previously.

If your Wi-Fi was fine, but suddenly it started disconnecting, then don’t forget to check the recently installed apps. This is because with not knowing the damage it can cause, you might have installed some VPNs, connections boosters, or firewalls. You can try and disable them but if that doesn’t resolve the problem, then uninstall the app.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: For uninstalling the problematic application, you have to select it and hold it. You will see a pop-up menu of multiple options; choose the option of ‘Uninstall’ to remove the app from the phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-9.jpg"                      alt="tap on uninstall button"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>It’s annoying that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting while you are working or studying.

As the following window appears on the screen, select the “Reboot” option to restart the Android device successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-1.jpg"                      alt="restart the android device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Shut-down-unnecessary-running-apps"><a href="#Part-4-Shut-down-unnecessary-running-apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Shut down unnecessary running apps"></a>Part 4: Shut down unnecessary running apps</h2><p>Another quick solution to avoid Android devices crashing is to shut down unnecessary apps running in the Poco C50 device’s background. To cater to that, you need to try out the following steps as a remedy to shutting down unwanted applications:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the “Settings” of your Poco C50 and continue to the “Battery and device care” section from the available options. Continue to the “Memory” section on the next window to lead to the applications taking up space on your Poco C50.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on battery and device care"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you progress further, you need to select the “Clean now” button to shut down all unnecessary background applications running on the Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-3.jpg"                      alt="press the clean now button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-Uninstall-incompatible-Apps-to-fix-Android-crash-issue"><a href="#Part-5-Uninstall-incompatible-Apps-to-fix-Android-crash-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Uninstall incompatible Apps to fix Android crash issue"></a>Part 5: Uninstall incompatible Apps to fix Android crash issue</h2><p>If your Android system crash takes place frequently but the Poco C50 device turns on normally after that, there is a chance that some Apps may be causing the problem. Unnecessary and large App files burden the Poco C50 device system and force it to crash every now and then. Make sure you download, install and store only those Apps which are fully compatible with your Android system. DO NOT download Apps from other unknown sources and use only Google Play store for the purpose. All other incompatible Apps must be deleted to prevent them from tweaking your software.</p><p>To uninstall unwanted and incompatible Apps, please follow the steps below.</p><p>1. Visit “Settings” and search for “Application Manager” or “Apps”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988991424495.jpg"                      alt="application manager"                ></p><p>Select the App you wish to uninstall.

The need to free up space arouses the need to know about the potential steps for checking storage and cleaning up space, which is discussed as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to navigate into “Settings” and look for the “Battery and device care” section. As you lead next, select the “Storage” option to check the Android storage and see how it is segregated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-4.jpg"                      alt="open the storage settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you navigate to the next screen, you can free up space by removing the applications from your Android. For that, tap on “Apps” to open a section containing the list of applications installed on the Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-5.jpg"                      alt="access the installed apps info"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go through the list of applications and select any app you want to remove. As you navigate next, select “Uninstall” to lead to removing the app from the Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-6.jpg"                      alt="press the uninstall option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-7-Clear-cache-partition-to-fix-Android-crash-issue"><a href="#Part-7-Clear-cache-partition-to-fix-Android-crash-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Clear cache partition to fix Android crash issue"></a>Part 7: Clear cache partition to fix Android crash issue</h2><p>Clearing cache is a good idea because it cleans your device and reduces the burden on the Android software and gives it enough space to function normally and carry out its operations.</p><p>In case the Android system crash issue is temporary, follow the steps given below to clear your device’s cache:</p><p>1. On your Poco C50, visit “Settings” and find “Storage”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14989068987919.jpg"                      alt="android settings"                ></p><p>2. Now tap on “Cached Data”, and then click “OK” to clear all unwanted cache from your device as shown above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988992219452.jpg"                                     ></p><p>However, if the Android crash problem is such that your phone has frozen, becomes unresponsive, and does not turn on, you must first boot into the Recovery Mode screen.</p><p>1. Press the volume down button and power button together until you see a screen with multiple options before you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988992495864.jpg"                      alt="boot in recovery mode"                ></p><p>2. Once you are on the Recovery Mode screen, use the volume down key to scroll down and select ”Wipe cache partition” as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988992704405.jpeg"                      alt="wipe cache partition"                ></p><p>3. After the process is completed, select “Reboot System” which is the first option in the recovery mode screen.</p><p>This method will help you erase all the clogged-up and unwanted files and resolve the Android system crash issue. If clearing cache doesn’t help, try formatting your SD Card.</p><h2 id="Part-8-Remove-the-SD-card-to-fix-the-Android-crash-issue"><a href="#Part-8-Remove-the-SD-card-to-fix-the-Android-crash-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Remove the SD card to fix the Android crash issue"></a>Part 8: Remove the SD card to fix the Android crash issue</h2><p>Removing and formatting your SD Card to fix the Android System crash issue is helpful when a corrupted SD Card disturbs the Android software forcing it to shut down suddenly.</p><p>To format your SD Card, just follow the instructions below.</p><p>1.

It is very common to see a brick smartphone these days. If you are wondering what exactly is a bricked phone, here is your answer.</p><p>A bricked phone, hard brick or soft brick, is a smartphone which refuses to start or boot all the way up the home&#x2F;main screen of the Oppo Reno 8T device. This issue is observed within most Android phones because users have a tendency to tamper with the Oppo Reno 8T device settings, flashing new and customized ROMs and tweaking with the essential files. Playing around with the phone’s internal set-up leads to such errors, worst of them being a brick smartphone. Usually, a bricked phone does not switch on and stays frozen at the Oppo Reno 8T device logo, a blank screen or even worse, doesn’t respond to any command, even the power on command.</p><p>If you are confused about the soft brick and hard brick problems and looking for solutions to fix your priced phone, then here is all you need to know.</p><p>Read on to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?"></a>Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?</h2><p>To begin with, let us understand the basic difference between a soft brick and hard brick issue. Both versions of a bricked phone prevent it from booting but differ in their causes and gravity of the problem.</p><p>A soft-brick problem is caused merely by a software error&#x2F;crash and makes your device switch on automatically every time you manually turn it off. This phenomenon is referred to as Boot Loop. Soft bricked Android phones are not as difficult to fix as the hard bricked Android phones. It is convenient to say that a soft bricked phone only boots up half-way and not fully, whereas a hard bricked device does not switch on at all. A hard brick error is thus caused when the kernel, which is nothing but an interface for the software to communicate with the hardware, is tampered with. A hard bricked phone is not recognized by your PC when plugged in and is a serious problem. It requires troubleshooting techniques and cannot be easily fixed as the soft brick problem.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987188976168.jpeg" alt="hard bricked v/s soft bricked "></p><p>Hard bricked phones are a rare sight, but the soft brick is very common. Given below are ways to fix a soft brick Android phone. The techniques listed here are the best and the most efficient ways to get your phone back to its normal working conditions without losing your important data or damaging your device or its software.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop"><a href="#Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop"></a>Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop</h2><p>This is the first sign of a soft bricked Android phone. Boot Loop is nothing but when your phone does not remain switched off and turns itself on automatically, and freezes at the logo screen or blank screen, every time you manually try to power it off.</p><p>Stuck at boot loop problem can be fixed by clearing your Cache partitions. These partitions are nothing but storage locations for your modem, kernels, system files, drivers and built-in Apps data.</p><p>It is advisable to clear Cache partitions regularly to keep your phone free from such glitches.</p><p>Since the phone refuses to boot, Cache can be cleared from entering into the Recovery Mode. Different Android devices have different ways to put it in recovery mode. Normally pressing the power key and volume down key helps, but you may refer to your phone’s guide for better understanding and then follow the steps given below to clear the cache partition:</p><p>Once you are the recovery mode screen, you will see a number of options as shown in the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987490613783.jpg"                      alt="recovery mode"                ></p><p>Use the volume down key to scroll down and select ”Wipe cache partition” as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987491246838.jpg"                      alt="”Wipe cache partition”"                >&gt;</p><p>After the process is completed, select “Reboot System” which is the first option in the recovery mode screen.</p><p>This method will help you erase all the clogged up and unwanted files. You may loose some App related data, but that is a small price to pay to fix your bricked phone.</p><p>If this method does not boot up your brick smartphone and the problem still persists, there are two more things you can try.

To answer this question, it’s essential to understand that this error is often associated with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol issues.</p><p>SSL is a cryptographic protocol created to establish a secure communication channel over the internet. Its primary purpose is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a user’s device and a website’s server.</p><p>The error message appears when there’s a problem with the SSL&#x2F;TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate of the website you are trying to access. This certificate is a digital document that authenticates the website and encrypts the data transmitted between the user’s device and the server.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Your connection is not private error on Android."                ></p><p>Some common factors that could trigger the <strong>“your connection is not private” on Chrome Android error</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Expired or invalid SSL certificate of the website;</strong></li></ol><p>Certificates are issued for a specific period, and if the website owner fails to renew it in time, your browser will detect it as not secure.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>There is a mismatch between the domain on the certificate and the actual domain you are trying to visit;</strong></li></ol><p>This discrepancy might occur due to a misconfiguration on the website or, in some cases, due to a man-in-the-middle attack where a third party intercepts the communication between your device and the server.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>No HTTPS enforcement;</strong></li></ol><p>Another reason for the issue is if the installed SSL certificate doesn’t turn on the “force HTTPS” option. This means visitors might be using the non-secure HTTP version of the site instead of the safe URL.</p><p>So, the error serves as a warning to users, indicating that the connection may not be secure and sensitive information could be at risk.</p><p>Browsers, including those on Android devices, prioritize user safety and privacy.

If you encounter this error, it implies that the website’s SSL certificate is outdated and needs to be updated with a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID: Unauthenticated SSL certificate</strong></li></ol><p>The presence of this error code suggests that the SSL certificate of the website cannot be authenticated by your browser. This could occur if the certificate is self-signed or issued by an unrecognized Certificate Authority.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID: Date and time mismatch</strong></li></ol><p>This error code points to a discrepancy between your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G’s date and time settings and the information on the website’s SSL certificate, as they have expiration dates.

Update the App</p><p>It is always advisable to keep your Android software as well as your Apps up-to-date and you must constantly check for any updates which may be available in the Google Play Store.</p><p>Follow the steps given below to update the app which won’t open on your phone:</p><p>• Visit Google Play Store on your Oppo Reno 10 5G.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984583996008.jpg"                      alt="Visit Google Play Store"                ></p><p>• Now select “My Apps &amp; Games” from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183627979.jpg"                      alt="select “My Apps &amp; Games"                ></p><p>• In this step, you may click on “Update All” to update all Apps for which an update is available or manually select the Apps which you wish to Update.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183782889.jpg"                      alt="Update All"                ></p><p>Once the App is updated, close all Apps and tabs running in the background. Now try to launch the app once again. If it opens, your problem is solved. If not, DO NOT worry as there are more ways to help you.</p><p>2. Force Stop the App</p><p>Closing the App completely which won’t open on your phone is a good idea. To make sure that no operations are running in the background related to the App, you must “Force Stop” it. Doing this is extremely simple and all you need to do is follow the steps given herein under:</p><p>• Visit “Settings” on your phone.</p><p>• Click on “Apps” to see a list of all the Apps on your Oppo Reno 10 5G.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184003158.jpg"                      alt="Click on “Apps”"                ></p><p>• Select the App which won’t open.</p><p>• Now click on “Force Stop” as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184186018.jpg"                      alt="click on “Force Stop”"                ></p><p>3. Clear App Cache and Data</p><p>This method resolves the issue to a great extent by wiping off unnecessary App content from your device.</p><p>Carefully follow the step-by-step instructions given below to clear all App cache and data:</p><p>• Visit “Settings” and select “Apps”.</p><p>• From the list of Apps that appears, select the App that won’t open.</p><p>• Now tap on “Clear Cache” and “Clear data” directly or under “Storage”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984585184488.jpg"                      alt="Clear data"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-3-Common-fix-if-all-Apps-won’t-open-on-Android"><a href="#Part-4-3-Common-fix-if-all-Apps-won’t-open-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 3 Common fix if all Apps won’t open on Android"></a>Part 4: 3 Common fix if all Apps won’t open on Android</h2><p>In this segment, we will discuss solutions to the problem if all your Apps won’t open. They are simple and easy to follow and solve the error in no time.</p><p>1. Android updates</p><p>Firstly, it is very important to keep your Android software updated at all times as an old Android version might not support new Apps or updated Apps.</p><p>To update your software:</p><p>• Visit “Settings” and keep going downwards.</p><p>• Now select “About Phone”.</p><p>• From the options available on the screen, tap on “System Updates”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184697337.jpg"                      alt="tap on “System Updates"                ></p><p>• In this step, if you are prompted for an update, follow the instruction given and do so.</p><p>Updating your Android software solves most of your problems.

All you need to do is:</p><p>• Long press the power button.</p><p>• Now click on “Restart”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184913200.jpg"                      alt="click on “Restart”"                ></p><p>Your phone will automatically restart and once it does, you can try to launch the App. You may also restart your Oppo Reno 10 5G by pressing the power button for about 15-20 seconds.</p><p>3.

Updating your Oppo A1 5G’s software version can be an effective solution to fix the issue of the phone repeatedly turning off. Regular software updates provided by the phone manufacturer often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches. These updates can address underlying problems that may be causing the random shutdowns, ensuring a more stable and reliable phone performance.</p><p>To update the software on your Oppo A1 5G, follow these steps:</p><p>Go to “Settings” on your Oppo A1 5G and navigate to the “System” or “Software Update” section (the exact wording may vary depending on your device model and Android version). Look for the option to “Check for updates” to see if any new software updates are available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off.jpg"                      alt="update software"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-Cool-down-your-phone-to-avoid-your-phone-keeps-turning-off"><a href="#Part-5-Cool-down-your-phone-to-avoid-your-phone-keeps-turning-off" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off"></a>Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off</h2><p>When a phone overheats, it can trigger an automatic shutdown as a protective mechanism to prevent damage to the Oppo A1 5G device’s internal components. Overheating occurs when the phone’s internal temperature rises significantly, typically due to excessive heat generated by the processor and other hardware components during intensive tasks or prolonged usage.</p><p>To prevent the phone from turning off due to overheating, you can take various measures, such as limiting intensive usage, avoiding direct sunlight and hot environments, and using the phone on hard surfaces to aid heat dissipation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off-1.jpg"                      alt="cool down the phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-Narrow-down-the-randomly-turning-off-issue-in-Safe-Mode"><a href="#Part-6-Narrow-down-the-randomly-turning-off-issue-in-Safe-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode"></a>Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode</h2><p>Starting your phone in Safe Mode is a good way to narrow down whether or not the problem is occurring because of some heavy and incompatible Apps as Safe Mode allows only built-in Apps to function.

Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail"></a>Part 1: Not Ringing? Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail</h2><p>If an incoming call to your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:</p><ol><li>Turn Off Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode</li></ol><p>DND mode is a feature that silences all incoming calls, notifications, and alerts. If DND mode is enabled, your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone calls. To turn off DND mode, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification settings panel, then tap the <strong>Do not disturb</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-02.jpg"                      alt="do not disturb mode not enabled"                ></p><p>Here’s an alternative way:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Notifications</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Do not disturb</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-03.jpg"                      alt="notifications settings interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> offto disable the mode.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Turn Off Call Forwarding</li></ol><p>One reason calls go <strong>straight to voicemail without ringing</strong> is if you enabled call forwarding. Call forwarding is a feature that redirects incoming calls to another number. To turn off call forwarding:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone Dialer</strong> app on your device, then tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-04.jpg"                      alt="phone dial app settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>Supplementary services</strong> &gt; <strong>Call forwarding</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-05.jpg"                      alt="call settings supplementary services"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>Disable Call Barring</li></ol><p>If a phone <strong>call went straight to voicemail</strong>, another possible explanation is the call barring. It is a feature that restricts calls from being made or received on your phone. If activated, it can cause incoming calls to a phone to go straight to voicemail. To turn off call barring on OnePlus Ace 2 devices:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone Dialer</strong> app, then tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Supplementary services</strong> &gt; <strong>Call barring</strong>, then tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>Voice call</strong>, then turn off your preferred outgoing and incoming calls. When prompted, enter 0000 as a password.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-06.jpg"                      alt="call barring settings interface"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>Update Your Phone’s Software</li></ol><p>Sometimes, software bugs can cause problems with incoming calls, which may be why your last incoming <strong>call went straight to voicemail</strong>. If your phone runs outdated software, try updating it to the latest version.</p><p>To check for updates, open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Software update</strong> or <strong>System update</strong>. For a seamless update experience, follow the step-by-step instructions on your mobile screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-07.jpg"                      alt="software update settings"                ></p><ol start="5"><li>Reset Network Settings</li></ol><p>If the incoming calls on your <strong>phone go straight to voicemail</strong>, consider resetting your phone’s network settings. Network settings control how your phone connects to the cellular network. If these settings are not set up correctly, incoming calls may not be able to reach your device.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Resetting your network settings will erase any saved Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth pairings, requiring you to re-enter them after the reset is complete.</p><p>To reset your network settings on most Android devices:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your smartphone, then tap <strong>System</strong> or <strong>General Management</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset Network Settings</strong> and confirm the action.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-08.jpg"                      alt="phone reset network settings"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>Turn Off Bluetooth</li></ol><p>When Bluetooth is on, it can interfere with your device’s ability to receive calls, causing them to go <strong>straight to voicemail without ringing</strong>. To turn off <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-16/fix-wifi-bluetooth-issues-after-upgrading-ios-16.html"><u> Bluetooth</u></a> on an Android device, you can do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Swipe down from the top of the screen to open the Quick Settingspanel, then tap the <strong>Bluetooth</strong> icon to turn it off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-09.jpg"                      alt="bluetooth not enabled"                ></p><ul><li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Connections</strong> &gt; <strong>Bluetooth</strong> and toggle the switch off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-10.jpg"                      alt="turn off bluetooth on settings app"                ></p><p>It should help ensure that calls come through to your phone instead of going to voicemail.</p><ol start="7"><li>Check Airplane Mode</li></ol><p>If turning off Bluetooth didn’t solve the issue, another possible cause could be that your phone is in Airplane Mode.

There are two ways to turn off Airplane mode on Android:</p><p>Using the Settings app:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Network &amp; internet</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong>.</li></ul><p>Using the Quick Settings panel:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Swipe down from the top of the phone screen to access the <strong>Quick Settings</strong> panel.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for the <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong> icon, then tap it to turn it off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-11.jpg"                      alt="airplane mode on"                ></p><ol start="8"><li>Check Blocked Numbers</li></ol><p><strong>“My boyfriend’s phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone is calling. Any idea why that might be?”</p><p>Do you also find yourself asking what does it mean? It could be that he has blocked that phone number. To check this:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone dialer</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Block numbers</strong>. If you find the number in the blocked list, remove it to ensure that their calls come through to the phone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-12.jpg"                      alt="block numbers on the phone"                ></p><p>If you still have trouble reaching your boyfriend, try calling him from a different number. If your call didn’t go through, you know that he hasn’t blocked your number and that there may be another issue with his phone.</p><ol start="9"><li>Turn Off Google One VPN</li></ol><p>If you’re using Google One VPN, try turning it off to see if that fixes the problem. Some users have reported that Google One VPN can cause incoming calls to a <strong>phone to go straight to voicemail</strong>. To turn off Google One VPN:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Google One</strong> app on your OnePlus Ace 2.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> At the bottom, go to the <strong>Benefits</strong> tab, then tap <strong>View Details</strong> below the <strong>Online protection with a VPN</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-13.jpg"                      alt="google one app interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Enable VPN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-14.jpg"                      alt="turn off google one vpn"                ></p><ol start="10"><li>Contact Your Carrier</li></ol><p>If your <strong>phone calls go straight to voicemail</strong> after trying all the above, contact your carrier for help. They may be able to troubleshoot the problem or determine if there is a service outage in your area.</p><p>And if your carrier confirms that there is no service outage or billing-related block, the problem may be with your phone itself. You may need to try resetting your phone to factory settings or taking it to a repair shop.</p><ol start="11"><li>The Caller Used Ringless Voicemail</li></ol><p>Ringless voicemail is a service that allows businesses to bypass your phone’s ringtone and send you pre-recorded messages directly to voicemail. Ringless voicemail is often used for marketing purposes. If you think you’re receiving ringless voicemail calls, you can contact the company calling you and ask them to remove you from their list.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Not-Clear-About-the-Root-Cause-Troubleshoot-Directly-by-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-2-Not-Clear-About-the-Root-Cause-Troubleshoot-Directly-by-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Not Clear About the Root Cause?

But what exactly is Android WebView, and what triggers these apps to crash?</p><p>Android WebView is an integral component of Android apps, acting as the invisible engine that renders web content within these apps. It allows users to seamlessly browse websites, watch videos, and interact with web pages without switching to a separate browser. However, when WebView crashes, it disrupts this integrated experience, causing apps to malfunction.</p><p>Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing <strong>Android WebView crash</strong>. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>App Freezing</strong></li></ul><p>One of the earliest signs of an <strong>Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ Android System WebView crash</strong> is the app freezing.

They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.</p><p>In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Nokia G310 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Nokia G310 device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Nokia G310 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Nokia G310 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Nokia G310 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Nokia G310 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Nokia-G310-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Nokia-G310-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Nokia G310 is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Nokia G310 is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Nokia G310 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Nokia G310s.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Nokia G310 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Nokia G310 device. So if your Nokia G310 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.</p><h3 id="Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow"><a href="#Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Animation Speed is Way Too Slow"></a>Animation Speed is Way Too Slow</h3><p>You can modify the Nokia G310 device’s animation type and speed on your Nokia G310 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Nokia G310 to launch an app or complete a certain process.</p><h3 id="You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version"><a href="#You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version" class="headerlink" title="You’re Using an Outdated Android Version"></a>You’re Using an Outdated Android Version</h3><p>If your Nokia G310 is running slow and freezing, the Nokia G310 device’s software is probably outdated.

Why Is Your Nokia C32 Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Nokia C32 Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Nokia C32 has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Nokia C32 functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Nokia C32, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot.

This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Nokia C32 device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Nokia C32 to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Nokia C32 could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.

If you find any damage, you may need to take your phone to a professional repair shop or consider getting a replacement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-04.jpg"                      alt="phone with damaged screen from dropping"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> If you have a screen protector or case, remove them because they can interfere with the process. This step will allow you to get a clear view of the screen and accurately assess the <strong><strong>dead pixel on the phone</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-05.jpg"                      alt="smartphone and a screen protector"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Remove any gloves you may be wearing and any stickers placed over the screen or sensors. Gloves and stickers can interfere with the touchscreen and affect the accuracy of fixing the <strong><strong>broken pixels on the phone</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> Finally, ensure that your screen is clean and free from any smudges or dirt that could affect the accuracy of fixing <strong><strong>dead pixels on the phone</strong></strong>. You can use a microfiber cloth to clean your screen gently, making sure not to apply too much pressure or use any harsh chemicals that could damage the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-06.jpg"                      alt="wiping phone screen with clean cloth"                ></p><h3 id="Option-2-Restart-Your-Nokia-C12-Pro"><a href="#Option-2-Restart-Your-Nokia-C12-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Option 2: Restart Your Nokia C12 Pro"></a>Option 2: Restart Your Nokia C12 Pro</h3><p>This method may seem simple, but it can be the most effective solution to your problem. Here is how you restart most smartphones available in the market.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Press and hold down the <strong><strong>power key</strong></strong> on your Nokia C12 Pro until the <strong><strong>power menu</strong></strong> appears.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Select <strong><strong>Restart</strong></strong> on your phone’s screen.

Sometimes, stuck pixels may only show up when using particular apps, so identifying which app is causing the issue can help pinpoint the problem.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Put your smartphone in <strong><strong>Safe Mode</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Visit the help page for your device’s manufacturer to learn how to activate and deactivate safe mode. Safe mode disables all downloaded programs momentarily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-08.jpg"                      alt="safe mode on the android screen"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the <strong><strong>stuck pixel phone</strong></strong> display. Next, turn off <strong><strong>Safe Mode</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.</p><h3 id="Option-4-Perform-Factory-Data-Reset"><a href="#Option-4-Perform-Factory-Data-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset"></a>Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset</h3><p>Consider a factory data reset if the previous options did not resolve your issue with stuck or dead pixels on the phone screen.
