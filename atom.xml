This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time.

This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Vivo V30 Lite 5G. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues.

How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone</h2><p>How to prevent a device from “bricking” itself and how to repair it if it does The delay is set by the MCU, but it should be long enough to allow the debug adapter to connect to the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device and halt it before the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device disables itself.</p><p>Here are some things to remember to prevent your device from bricking:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoiding unofficial firmware updates:</strong> Installing unapproved OS firmware on your phone will most certainly violate any manufacturer’s warranty you have on it. Read the installation instructions for your unique phone model thoroughly and then carefully follow them, taking time and patience.</li><li>**Being cautious when rooting or jail breaking:**Rooting and Jail breaking disables parts of the operating system’s built-in security mechanisms, which are part of what makes the operating system safe, and your data protected from exposure or damage.</li><li>**Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.</li><li><strong>Backup your phone data regularly:</strong> Backing up your phone safeguards your data in the event that you lose it, it is stolen, or it no longer works. When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.</li><li><strong>Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:</strong> Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It is certainly upsetting when your gadget bricks, but you may attempt the solutions listed above to resolve the issue.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode.

Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.</p><ol start="2"><li>How do you fix a boot loop?</li></ol><p>When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.</p><p>For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup. You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.</p><ol start="3"><li>How to prevent a boot loop?</li></ol><p>A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle. Most issues are software-related, such as having to do a system upgrade gone wrong or a problem that doesn’t mesh. One way to prevent this is to perform a software or system upgrade constantly. Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>3,405,439</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article summarizes some of the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.

It will be ironic if that device, supposed to grant convenience, provides problems instead. Some people face this when their <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and unable to do anything. As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Vivo-Y200-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Vivo-Y200-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Vivo Y200 Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Vivo Y200 Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Vivo Y200 has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Vivo Y200 functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Vivo Y200, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Vivo Y200 when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Vivo Y200 to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Vivo Y200 device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Vivo Y200 to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Vivo Y200 could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Vivo Y200:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Android Phone Stuck On Boot Screen"></a>Part 3.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Vivo V30. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode.

It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone.

It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Vivo V30 has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Vivo V30 functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Vivo V30, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot.

It will be ironic if that device, supposed to grant convenience, provides problems instead. Some people face this when their <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and unable to do anything. As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Vivo-S17e-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Vivo-S17e-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Vivo S17e Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Vivo S17e Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Vivo S17e has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Vivo S17e functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Vivo S17e, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Vivo S17e when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Vivo S17e to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Vivo S17e device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Vivo S17e to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Vivo S17e could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Vivo S17e:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Android Phone Stuck On Boot Screen"></a>Part 3.

An “Application not installed” error message usually pops up when you are trying to download and install an App with a .apk file extension from somewhere other than the Google Play Store. The error is very confusing at first but makes sense when you realize that this unknown Error Code during Application installation is neither a software issue nor a hardware problem. It is a direct outcome of what you do with your device. Yes, you heard that right. Your faulty actions can cause Android App not installed error.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/app-not-installed-error-in-android.jpg"                      alt="app not install on android"                ></p><p>What to do when trying to install the Android APK it says “app not installed”? It is terrible that you can’t install App on your device. But in this article, you will know more about the causes behind this error and the best ways to fix it, read on, here is all you need to know.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error"><a href="#Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error"></a>Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error</h2><p>You may ask: Why can’t I download apps on my Vivo S17e? Understanding the underlying causes of the “Android App Not Installed” error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:</p><p>1. Insufficient storage</p><p>Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.</p><p>2. Corrupted&#x2F;Contaminated App file</p><p>When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.</p><p>3. SD Card not mounted in the Vivo S17e device</p><p>At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.</p><p>4. Storage location</p><p>You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Vivo S17e device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn’t installed because of an unknown Error Code.</p><p>5. Corrupt storage</p><p>Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn’t installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.</p><p>6. Application Permission</p><p>Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.</p><p>7. Incorrect file</p><p>If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.</p><p>The Unknown Error Code during Application installation can occur due to any one or more of the reasons stated above. So read them carefully and understand them well to avoid such glitches in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994439892909.jpg"                      alt="application not installed" title="application not installed"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error"></a>Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error</h2><p>So App not installed on your Vivo S17e or tablet?

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Vivo S17t. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Vivo S17t or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Vivo S17t&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Vivo S17t reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Vivo S17t Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

Restart your Android and try to update again"></a>Method 1. Restart your Android and try to update again</h3><p>In most cases, restarting the Vivo S17t device can simply do the trick. When you restart the Vivo S17t device, most of the issues get eliminated making the Vivo S17t device perform better than before. Also, it is all about RAM. While you restart your device, the RAM gets cleared. As a result, the apps work properly. So, in the first place, we would like you to restart your Vivo S17t when you cannot update Google Play Services. Once restarted, try to update again and see if the results are positive.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Uninstall-Google-Play-Services-Updates-and-Reattempt-the-Update"><a href="#Method-2-Uninstall-Google-Play-Services-Updates-and-Reattempt-the-Update" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Uninstall Google Play Services Updates and Reattempt the Update"></a>Method 2. Uninstall Google Play Services Updates and Reattempt the Update</h3><p>Uninstalling previous Google Play Services updates resolves conflicts and errors, often addressing the issue of updates. This process clears potential obstacles, enabling a successful update of Google Play Services. Here’s how you can do it:</p><ol><li>Open your device’s “Settings.”</li><li>Scroll down and select “Apps” or “App Manager.”</li><li>Locate and tap on “Google Play Services.”</li><li>Depending on your device and Android version, you might need to tap on “App info” or “Storage.”</li><li>Look for the option to “Uninstall updates.” This will revert Google Play Services to its original version.</li><li>Confirm the action when prompted.</li><li>Once the updates are uninstalled, go back to the Google Play Store.</li><li>Search for “Google Play Services” using the search bar at the top.</li><li>If an update is available, you’ll see the option to “Update.” Tap on it to start the update process.</li><li>After the update is complete, restart your device to ensure the changes take effect.</li></ol><h3 id="Method-3-Update-Google-Play-Store"><a href="#Method-3-Update-Google-Play-Store" class="headerlink" title="Method 3.

Uninstall unnecessary apps"></a>Method 5. Uninstall unnecessary apps</h3><p>As we mentioned above, due to a lot of apps being installed at the same time, the issue can crop up. And hence, if the above solution didn’t help, you can try to uninstall the apps that you don’t need currently. We hope this works. But if not, you can go to the next fix.</p><h3 id="Method-6-Clear-Google-Play-Services-cache"><a href="#Method-6-Clear-Google-Play-Services-cache" class="headerlink" title="Method 6. Clear Google Play Services cache"></a>Method 6. Clear Google Play Services cache</h3><p>If still you cannot update Google Play Services, clearing cache can solve your problem. We also stated this in the beginning as the reason. If you don’t know, cache holds the app’s data temporarily so that it can remember the information when you next open the app. Many times, old cache files get corrupted. And clearing cache can also help in saving storage space on your device. For these reasons, you need to clear cache of Google Play Services to get rid of the problem.</p><p>Here is how to clear Google Play Services cache:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/clear-cache.jpg"                      alt="set correct date and time"                ></p><ul><li>Launch “Settings” on your phone and go to “Apps &amp; Notifications” or “Application” or “Application Manager”.</li><li>Now, from all the apps’ list, choose “Google Play Services”.</li><li>On opening it, tap “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-7-Boot-into-download-mode-to-clear-cache-of-whole-phone"><a href="#Method-7-Boot-into-download-mode-to-clear-cache-of-whole-phone" class="headerlink" title="Method 7. Boot into download mode to clear cache of whole phone"></a>Method 7. Boot into download mode to clear cache of whole phone</h3><p>If unfortunately, things are still the same, we would like to recommend you wipe the cache of the whole device to fix the issue.

Every device has its own steps for this. Like in some, you need to simultaneously press the “Power” and “Volume Down” keys. While in some, the “Power” and both “Volume” keys work.</p><p>This is how it works when Google Play Services can’t be installed on your device:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/wipe-data.jpg"                      alt="google play services not installing - wipe cache"                ></p><ul><li>Turn off the Vivo S17t device to begin with and then follow the steps for recovery mode.</li><li>On the recovery screen, use the “Volume” buttons for scrolling up and down and go to “Wipe cache partition”.</li><li>To confirm, press the “Power” button.

This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

This issue has plagued Android users, causing app crashes, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-frozen/iphone-keeps-freezing.html" >freezing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and frustration. But what exactly is Android WebView, and what triggers these apps to crash?</p><p>Android WebView is an integral component of Android apps, acting as the invisible engine that renders web content within these apps. It allows users to seamlessly browse websites, watch videos, and interact with web pages without switching to a separate browser. However, when WebView crashes, it disrupts this integrated experience, causing apps to malfunction.</p><p>Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing <strong>Android WebView crash</strong>. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>App Freezing</strong></li></ul><p>One of the earliest signs of an <strong>Vivo Y78 5G Android System WebView crash</strong> is the app freezing. The app may become unresponsive, refusing to respond to your taps or gestures.</p><ul><li><strong>Unexpected App Closures</strong></li></ul><p>Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. <strong>Vivo Y78 5G Android System WebView crashing apps</strong> can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.</p><ul><li><strong>Error Messages</strong></li></ul><p>Error messages can also provide valuable clues about the impending crash. These messages may appear as pop-ups or be displayed within the app itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-02.jpg"                      alt="webview crash google app"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Slow Loading Times</strong></li></ul><p>Slow loading times can also be a sign of an impending crash. If webpages within the app take unusually long to load or images and other content appear pixelated or distorted, it could be a sign that Vivo Y78 5G Android System WebView is struggling to handle the workload.</p><p>But why does WebView crash Android smartphones? The answer involves several factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Updates and Compatibility Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Updates are often intended to improve software stability and compatibility, but in some cases, they can introduce new bugs or compatibility issues that lead to crashes. It is particularly evident when app developers and WebView developers release updates that don’t fully align, causing conflicts.</p><ul><li><strong>Insufficient Memory</strong></li></ul><p>Vivo Y78 5G Android System WebView requires a certain amount of memory to operate properly. If your device is running low on memory, it can cause Vivo Y78 5G Android System WebView to crash. It is more likely to happen on older devices with less RAM.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-03.jpg"                      alt="webview crash out of memory message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Outdated Vivo Y78 5G Android System WebView</strong></li></ul><p>The WebView app is responsible for rendering web content within Android apps. Using an outdated version of WebView can introduce known bugs and security vulnerabilities that can cause crashes.</p><ul><li><strong>Conflicts With Other Apps</strong></li></ul><p>WebView might crash if it conflicts with other resources or processes running on the Vivo Y78 5G device. It can happen if the Vivo Y78 5G device runs low on memory or other resource-intensive apps compete for system resources.</p><p>In the next section, you’ll explore potential solutions to keep your apps running smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Android-WebView-Crashes-Here-Are-Quick-and-Proven-Solutions"><a href="#Part-2-Android-WebView-Crashes-Here-Are-Quick-and-Proven-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Android WebView Crashes?

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Vivo Y36i. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Vivo Y36i or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Vivo Y36i&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Vivo Y36i reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Vivo Y36i Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

Why Is Your Tecno Spark 10 Pro Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Tecno Spark 10 Pro Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Tecno Spark 10 Pro has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Tecno Spark 10 Pro functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Tecno Spark 10 Pro, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Tecno Spark 10 Pro when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Tecno Spark 10 Pro to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time.

Why Is Your Vivo S17 Pro Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Vivo S17 Pro Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Vivo S17 Pro has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Vivo S17 Pro functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Vivo S17 Pro, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Vivo S17 Pro when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Vivo S17 Pro to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Vivo S17 Pro device.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen.

This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.</p><p>With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.</p><p>To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) to the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device you were trying to use.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Vivo Y77t. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Vivo Y77t or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Vivo Y77t&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Vivo Y77t reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Vivo Y77t Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.</p><ol start="2"><li>How do you fix a boot loop?</li></ol><p>When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.</p><p>For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup.

You can now release the button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/enable-safe-mode.jpg"                      alt="safe mode"                ></p><h3 id="Reset-Factory-settings"><a href="#Reset-Factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="Reset Factory settings"></a>Reset Factory settings</h3><p>If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.</p><p>Along with this, we would also suggest you go take backup of your data so that you won’t lose any of the personal information from your device after performing factory reset. For your convenience, we have stated the backup steps too in the following guide. Have a look:</p><ul><li>Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup &amp; Reset”.</li><li>Notice if “Back up my data” is enabled or not. If not, turn it on and create backup.</li><li>Now, scroll for “Factory Data reset” option and confirm it by clicking “Reset Phone”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/reset-factory-settings.jpg"                      alt="reset factory settings"                ></p><ul><li>Wait a few minutes and your device will reboot.</li></ul><h3 id="Install-a-new-launcher-to-replace-TouchWiz"><a href="#Install-a-new-launcher-to-replace-TouchWiz" class="headerlink" title="Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz"></a>Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz</h3><p>We believe that you will find the above methods helpful. However, if still in case your <strong><em>TouchWiz is not working</em></strong>, we advice you that you should install a new theme launcher in your device. It will be a wise option to ditch TouchWiz in such scenario rather than tolerating the problem. Hope this advice will help you.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/reasons-for-asus-rog-phone-8-pro-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Reasons for Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Stuck on Startup Screen and Ways To Fix Them | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/what-to-do-when-nokia-c110-has-black-screen-of-death-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>What To Do When Nokia C110 Has Black Screen of Death? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/android-safe-mode-how-to-turn-off-safe-mode-on-oneplus-nord-n30-se-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Android Safe Mode - How to Turn off Safe Mode on OnePlus Nord N30 SE? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/best-methods-for-nokia-c22-wont-turn-on-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Best Methods for Nokia C22 Wont Turn On | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-problem-on-itel-p40-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Problem on Itel P40 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/reasons-for-oppo-a38-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Reasons for Oppo A38 Stuck on Boot Screen and Ways To Fix Them | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/bricked-your-infinix-smart-8-pro-heres-a-full-solution-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Bricked Your Infinix Smart 8 Pro?

It will be ironic if that device, supposed to grant convenience, provides problems instead. Some people face this when their <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and unable to do anything. As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Vivo-Y100i-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Vivo-Y100i-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Vivo Y100i Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Vivo Y100i Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Vivo Y100i has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Vivo Y100i functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Vivo Y100i, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Vivo Y100i when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Vivo Y100i to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Vivo Y100i device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Vivo Y100i to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Vivo Y100i could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Vivo Y100i:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Android Phone Stuck On Boot Screen"></a>Part 3.

This is mostly true and one of the components of Android’s recovery mode, factory mode or <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/wipe-data-factory-reset.html" >factory reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the most efficient ways to solve various problems on your device. While factory mode is often a good thing, there are times when your device can enter factory mode on its own. Other times, you can safely enter factory mode but not know how to get out.</p><p>Fortunately for you, this article will explain all aspects of factory mode and especially how to safely exit factory mode.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Android-Factory-Mode"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Android-Factory-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Several options are available for you once you enter Recovery mode on your device but few are as effective as the wipe data&#x2F; factory reset option. This option is useful in solving a whole host of problems that your device could be experiencing.</p><p>If you have been using your Vivo Y100i for a while now and its performance to be less than ideal, a factory reset might be a good solution. That is however not the only problem a factory reset or factory mode can solve.

Why Is Your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Xiaomi Redmi A2+, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out.

Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery!

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Vivo-Y27-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Vivo-Y27-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Vivo Y27 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Vivo Y27 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Vivo Y27 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Vivo Y27 5G functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Vivo Y27 5G, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Vivo Y27 5G when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Vivo Y27 5G to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Vivo Y27 5G device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Vivo Y27 5G to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Vivo Y27 5G could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Vivo Y27 5G:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

You might question yourself <strong>why does my Wi-Fi keep disconnecting from the phone</strong>? To know the answer, read the article below.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Your-Phone-Keep-Disconnecting-from-WiFi"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Your-Phone-Keep-Disconnecting-from-WiFi" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Your Phone Keep Disconnecting from WiFi?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Your Phone Keep Disconnecting from WiFi?</h2><p>Is your phone frequently getting disconnected from Wi-Fi? Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Vivo Y27 5G devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:</p><ul><li><strong>Router Problems</strong></li></ul><p>If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.</p><ul><li><strong>Out of Wi-Fi Range</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Why does My Vivo Y27 5G keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi</strong>? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.</p><ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked</strong></li></ul><p>The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.</p><ul><li><strong>Devices Connected with Router</strong></li></ul><p>Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded.

We will provide you with 10 solutions with complete assistance to fix the “<strong>Wi-fi keeps disconnecting Android</strong>“ issue.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_eAyzfmK8Vs"></iframe><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Your Phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Your Phone</h3><p>If the Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting from your Vivo Y27 5G, but the internet is stable, then you should try to fix the issue by restarting your phone. Sometimes, it’s the phone that’s causing a problem, so to resolve it, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Firstly, unlock your phone. Now, press the Power button and hold it for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, select the ‘Reboot’ option to resolve the issue from the options on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-1.jpg"                      alt="select reboot option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings"><a href="#Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Check Router Settings"></a>Fix 2: Check Router Settings</h3><p>If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings. This is because your phone might be blocked from connecting to the network, and if this is the scenario, your phone will never maintain the connection. You should check the Router’s admin panel or app to remove your phone from the blocklist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-2.jpg"                      alt="check router settings"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reconnect-to-Network"><a href="#Fix-3-Reconnect-to-Network" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reconnect to Network"></a>Fix 3: Reconnect to Network</h3><p>To fix the annoying problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting, you should try forgetting the network and then reconnecting to it. This could be done easily by following the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on your wifi option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: A list of all the Wi-Fi networks will appear on the screen. Select the network that is causing trouble from that list and hit the ‘Forget Network’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-4.jpg"                      alt="click on forgot network"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: After that, you should reconnect to this Wi-Fi network by selecting it from the Wi-Fi list and entering its password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-5.jpg"                      alt="enter wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router"><a href="#Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Restart Your Router"></a>Fix 4: Restart Your Router</h3><p>As we discussed, to restart your phone, you can also restart the router to get rid of the problem. For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start. If the Vivo Y27 5G device has no button, disconnect the power supply and plug it back in to connect again. Most internet issues are resolved by restarting the router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-6.jpg"                      alt="restart wifi router"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks"><a href="#Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Forget Old Networks"></a>Fix 5: Forget Old Networks</h3><p>The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-7.jpg"                      alt="open wifi settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You will see a list of all the Wi-Fi networks you have connected to previously. One by one, select each network and hit the ‘Forget Network’ button to remove it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-8.jpg"                      alt="forgot unnecessary wifi connections"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-6-Check-Recently-Installed-Applications"><a href="#Fix-6-Check-Recently-Installed-Applications" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6. Check Recently Installed Applications"></a>Fix 6. Check Recently Installed Applications</h3><p>Sometimes, different installed applications can also cause trouble. If your Wi-Fi was fine, but suddenly it started disconnecting, then don’t forget to check the recently installed apps. This is because with not knowing the damage it can cause, you might have installed some VPNs, connections boosters, or firewalls. You can try and disable them but if that doesn’t resolve the problem, then uninstall the app.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: For uninstalling the problematic application, you have to select it and hold it. You will see a pop-up menu of multiple options; choose the option of ‘Uninstall’ to remove the app from the phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-9.jpg"                      alt="tap on uninstall button"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>It’s annoying that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting while you are working or studying. Android users can easily get over this problem by resetting the network settings. The steps for this fix are as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: For resetting the network, start by opening the ‘Settings’ menu on your phone. Then, scroll down, look for the ‘Connection &amp; Sharing’ option, and select it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-10.jpg"                      alt="access connect and sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: As you progress onto a new screen, you will find the option of “Reset Wi-Fi, Mobile Networks, and Bluetooth” in the menu. Select the option to lead to the next window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-11.jpg"                      alt="open reset option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click on the option of “Reset Settings” present on the bottom of the next screen that shows up. Provide confirmation of resetting these settings by inserting your device’s PIN, if any.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-12.jpg"                      alt="click on reset settings button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: After providing the appropriate clearances, you will be asked for another confirmation of resetting the Vivo Y27 5G device’s networks to default. Click “OK” to execute.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-13.jpg"                      alt="tap on ok button"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-8-Check-Routers-Range"><a href="#Fix-8-Check-Routers-Range" class="headerlink" title="Fix 8: Check Routers Range"></a>Fix 8: Check Routers Range</h3><p>If your Wi-Fi automatically disconnects and connects again while you are roaming in the house, then it is because of the router’s range; you should check it. For this, you can consider changing and modifying your AP (Access Point) band on your router.</p><p>Although the 5GHz frequency band is recognized for providing better network speeds, this band has a shorter range as compared to the 2.4GHz band, which has a better coverage of area. You can easily shift your router’s range through its configuration page. It is considered optimal to utilize the 2.4GHz frequency band for better ranges.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-14.jpg"                      alt="change routers range"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-9-Stay-Connected-while-Asleep"><a href="#Fix-9-Stay-Connected-while-Asleep" class="headerlink" title="Fix 9: Stay Connected while Asleep"></a>Fix 9: Stay Connected while Asleep</h3><p>Most Android phones have a battery-saving feature. This feature disables the network connections to save the battery of the phone. If this is why the Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting, follow the steps shared below to fix it:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Start by opening the ‘Settings’ menu on your phone. Then scroll down until you find the ‘Battery’ option and open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-15.jpg"                      alt="open battery settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Then, from the battery screen, hit the ‘More Battery Settings’ options. Then, you will see the ‘Stay Connected while Asleep’ option; turn it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-16.jpg"                      alt="enable connected while asleep"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-10-Upgrade-Router-Firmware"><a href="#Fix-10-Upgrade-Router-Firmware" class="headerlink" title="Fix 10: Upgrade Router Firmware"></a>Fix 10: Upgrade Router Firmware</h3><p>If none of the above-shared fixes work, the last fix to resolve the problem is upgrading your router firmware.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator.

Why Is Your Vivo X100 Pro Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Vivo X100 Pro Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Vivo X100 Pro has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Vivo X100 Pro functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Vivo X100 Pro, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Vivo X100 Pro when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Vivo X100 Pro to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Vivo X100 Pro device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Vivo X100 Pro to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Vivo X100 Pro could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Vivo X100 Pro:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.
