Fix It Now"></a>Motorola Razr 40 Ultra Camera Not Working Unexpected Error? Fix It Now</h2><p>For all its glory and goodness, the Android OS often has its users pulling their hair in frustration at just how buggy the OS can be at times. So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today. People only launch the app when they want to take a photo, for everything else there’s a dedicated photo gallery app. What happens when you launch the camera app only to realize it threw an error and you missed your photo moment? Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="camera not working error in android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?"></a>Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Motorola Razr 40 Ultra.</p><p><strong>Low Memory</strong></p><p>Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.</p><p><strong>Low Storage</strong></p><p>The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Motorola Razr 40 Ultra. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Motorola Razr 40 Ultra right where you are, without needing to take the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera and tap Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache android"                ></p><h3 id="II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache"><a href="#II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache"></a>II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache</h3><p>The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg"                      alt="google play store app updates"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg"                      alt="check for app updates play store"                ></p><p>Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.</p><h3 id="II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down"><a href="#II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down" class="headerlink" title="II.VII: Cool The Phone Down"></a>II.VII: Cool The Phone Down</h3><p>We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.</p><p>If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.</p><h3 id="II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System"><a href="#II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System" class="headerlink" title="II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System"></a>II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System</h3><p>You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.</p><h3 id="II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)"></a>II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)</h3><p>Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre.

Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail</h2><p>If an incoming call to your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:</p><ol><li>Turn Off Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode</li></ol><p>DND mode is a feature that silences all incoming calls, notifications, and alerts. If DND mode is enabled, your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone calls. To turn off DND mode, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification settings panel, then tap the <strong>Do not disturb</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-02.jpg"                      alt="do not disturb mode not enabled"                ></p><p>Here’s an alternative way:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Notifications</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Do not disturb</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-03.jpg"                      alt="notifications settings interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> offto disable the mode.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Turn Off Call Forwarding</li></ol><p>One reason calls go <strong>straight to voicemail without ringing</strong> is if you enabled call forwarding. Call forwarding is a feature that redirects incoming calls to another number. To turn off call forwarding:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone Dialer</strong> app on your device, then tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-04.jpg"                      alt="phone dial app settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>Supplementary services</strong> &gt; <strong>Call forwarding</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-05.jpg"                      alt="call settings supplementary services"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>Disable Call Barring</li></ol><p>If a phone <strong>call went straight to voicemail</strong>, another possible explanation is the call barring. It is a feature that restricts calls from being made or received on your phone. If activated, it can cause incoming calls to a phone to go straight to voicemail. To turn off call barring on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra devices:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone Dialer</strong> app, then tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Supplementary services</strong> &gt; <strong>Call barring</strong>, then tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>Voice call</strong>, then turn off your preferred outgoing and incoming calls.

If your phone runs outdated software, try updating it to the latest version.</p><p>To check for updates, open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Software update</strong> or <strong>System update</strong>.

Airplane Mode turns off all wireless connections on your phone, including cellular service, which can cause calls to <strong>dial straight to voicemail</strong>. There are two ways to turn off Airplane mode on Android:</p><p>Using the Settings app:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Network &amp; internet</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong>.</li></ul><p>Using the Quick Settings panel:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Swipe down from the top of the phone screen to access the <strong>Quick Settings</strong> panel.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for the <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong> icon, then tap it to turn it off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-11.jpg"                      alt="airplane mode on"                ></p><ol start="8"><li>Check Blocked Numbers</li></ol><p><strong>“My boyfriend’s phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone is calling. Any idea why that might be?”</p><p>Do you also find yourself asking what does it mean? It could be that he has blocked that phone number. To check this:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone dialer</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Block numbers</strong>. If you find the number in the blocked list, remove it to ensure that their calls come through to the phone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-12.jpg"                      alt="block numbers on the phone"                ></p><p>If you still have trouble reaching your boyfriend, try calling him from a different number. If your call didn’t go through, you know that he hasn’t blocked your number and that there may be another issue with his phone.</p><ol start="9"><li>Turn Off Google One VPN</li></ol><p>If you’re using Google One VPN, try turning it off to see if that fixes the problem. Some users have reported that Google One VPN can cause incoming calls to a <strong>phone to go straight to voicemail</strong>. To turn off Google One VPN:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Google One</strong> app on your Motorola Razr 40 Ultra.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> At the bottom, go to the <strong>Benefits</strong> tab, then tap <strong>View Details</strong> below the <strong>Online protection with a VPN</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-13.jpg"                      alt="google one app interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Enable VPN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-14.jpg"                      alt="turn off google one vpn"                ></p><ol start="10"><li>Contact Your Carrier</li></ol><p>If your <strong>phone calls go straight to voicemail</strong> after trying all the above, contact your carrier for help. They may be able to troubleshoot the problem or determine if there is a service outage in your area.</p><p>And if your carrier confirms that there is no service outage or billing-related block, the problem may be with your phone itself. You may need to try resetting your phone to factory settings or taking it to a repair shop.</p><ol start="11"><li>The Caller Used Ringless Voicemail</li></ol><p>Ringless voicemail is a service that allows businesses to bypass your phone’s ringtone and send you pre-recorded messages directly to voicemail. Ringless voicemail is often used for marketing purposes. If you think you’re receiving ringless voicemail calls, you can contact the company calling you and ask them to remove you from their list.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Not-Clear-About-the-Root-Cause-Troubleshoot-Directly-by-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-2-Not-Clear-About-the-Root-Cause-Troubleshoot-Directly-by-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Not Clear About the Root Cause?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Motorola-Razr-40-Screen-Unresponsive-Here’s-How-to-Fix-It"><a href="#Motorola-Razr-40-Screen-Unresponsive-Here’s-How-to-Fix-It" class="headerlink" title="Motorola Razr 40 Screen Unresponsive? Here’s How to Fix It"></a>Motorola Razr 40 Screen Unresponsive? Here’s How to Fix It</h2><p>Motorola Razr 40 phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a <strong>Motorola Razr 40 touch screen not working</strong>, which can be frustrating and difficult.</p><p>This article aims to provide solutions for Motorola Razr 40 phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your <strong>Motorola Razr 40 touchscreen is not working</strong>, don’t worry – we’ve got you covered!</p><h2 id="What-Causes-A-Motorola-Razr-40-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#What-Causes-A-Motorola-Razr-40-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="What Causes A Motorola Razr 40 Screen Unresponsive?"></a>What Causes A Motorola Razr 40 Screen Unresponsive?</h2><p>There are several reasons why a Motorola Razr 40 phone’s screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It’s essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.</p><p>Below are some possible causes of Motorola Razr 40 screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Soft-bricked software:</strong> Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Motorola Razr 40 Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Motorola Razr 40 device unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment is worn out:</strong> Hardware problems can also cause Motorola Razr 40 screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Motorola Razr 40 model, including the Y2 and 5A.</p></li><li><p>**Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Motorola Razr 40 Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.</p></li></ul><h2 id="The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Motorola-Razr-40-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Motorola-Razr-40-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="The Common Solutions To Solve A Motorola Razr 40 Screen Unresponsive"></a>The Common Solutions To Solve A Motorola Razr 40 Screen Unresponsive</h2><p>In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Motorola Razr 40 screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Motorola Razr 40 model.</p><h3 id="1-Restart-The-Device"><a href="#1-Restart-The-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart The Device"></a>1. Restart The Device</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mui restart button"                ></p><p>Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Motorola Razr 40 black screen problem. It’s a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone’s memory.</p><p>It is the most commonly used method to fix Motorola Razr 40’s touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Motorola Razr 40 device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Motorola Razr 40 device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Motorola Razr 40logo appears.</p><h3 id="2-Leave-The-Phone-And-Let-The-Battery-Drain-Completely"><a href="#2-Leave-The-Phone-And-Let-The-Battery-Drain-Completely" class="headerlink" title="2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely"></a>2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg"                      alt="low battery"                ></p><p>Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Motorola Razr 40 device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Motorola Razr 40 device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Motorola Razr 40 device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.</p><h3 id="3-Contact-Custom-Service"><a href="#3-Contact-Custom-Service" class="headerlink" title="3. Contact Custom Service"></a>3. Contact Custom Service</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi contact customer service"                ></p><p>If restarting the Motorola Razr 40 device or allowing the battery to drain doesn’t resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Motorola Razr 40 device in for repair or replacement. It’s important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.</p><p>In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Motorola Razr 40 Y2 and Motorola Razr 40 5A.</p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Device-Performance"><a href="#4-Optimize-Device-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Device Performance"></a>4. Optimize Device Performance</h3><p>One solution is to optimize the Motorola Razr 40 device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.</p><p>You can clear your cached data using the default settings.</p><ul><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Storage</strong> &gt; <strong>Cached Data</strong>.</li><li>To clear the cache, select <strong>Clear Cache</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/clear-cached-data-on-xiaomi5a.png"                      alt="clear cached data on xiaomi 5a"                ></p><h3 id="5-Back-Up-And-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Back-Up-And-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Back Up And Factory Reset"></a>5. Back Up And Factory Reset</h3><p>Another solution is to back up the Motorola Razr 40 device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Motorola Razr 40 device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone’s settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Motorola Razr 40 device, so it should only be considered a last resort.</p><p>In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Motorola Razr 40 Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.</p><ul><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to the A<strong>dditional settings</strong> section of the Motorola Razr 40 Redmi 5A settings.</li><li>Please scroll down the screen until you reach the <strong>Backup &amp; reset</strong> option, then click to access it.</li><li>Click<strong>Erase all data (factory reset)</strong> to restore the network settings and applications, or completely reset the Motorola Razr 40 Redmi 5A.</li><li>Select <strong>All files on the phone</strong>to make a complete format of the Motorola Razr 40 Redmi 5A.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/factory-reset-on-xiaomi5a-1.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on xiaomi 5a"                ></p><h3 id="6-Using-Dr-Fone-Repair"><a href="#6-Using-Dr-Fone-Repair" class="headerlink" title="6. Using Dr. Fone Repair"></a>6. Using Dr. Fone Repair</h3><p>If none of the above solutions worked, you can try using Dr. Fone Repair.

Fix It Now"></a>Motorola Razr 40 Camera Not Working Unexpected Error? Fix It Now</h2><p>For all its glory and goodness, the Android OS often has its users pulling their hair in frustration at just how buggy the OS can be at times. So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today. People only launch the app when they want to take a photo, for everything else there’s a dedicated photo gallery app. What happens when you launch the camera app only to realize it threw an error and you missed your photo moment? Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="camera not working error in android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?"></a>Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Motorola Razr 40.</p><p><strong>Low Memory</strong></p><p>Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.</p><p><strong>Low Storage</strong></p><p>The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Motorola Razr 40. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Motorola Razr 40 right where you are, without needing to take the Motorola Razr 40 device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Motorola Razr 40 device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera and tap Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache android"                ></p><h3 id="II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache"><a href="#II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache"></a>II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache</h3><p>The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg"                      alt="google play store app updates"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg"                      alt="check for app updates play store"                ></p><p>Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.</p><h3 id="II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down"><a href="#II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down" class="headerlink" title="II.VII: Cool The Phone Down"></a>II.VII: Cool The Phone Down</h3><p>We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.</p><p>If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.</p><h3 id="II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System"><a href="#II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System" class="headerlink" title="II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System"></a>II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System</h3><p>You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.</p><h3 id="II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)"></a>II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)</h3><p>Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre.

Updating your Motorola Razr 40’s software version can be an effective solution to fix the issue of the phone repeatedly turning off. Regular software updates provided by the phone manufacturer often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches. These updates can address underlying problems that may be causing the random shutdowns, ensuring a more stable and reliable phone performance.</p><p>To update the software on your Motorola Razr 40, follow these steps:</p><p>Go to “Settings” on your Motorola Razr 40 and navigate to the “System” or “Software Update” section (the exact wording may vary depending on your device model and Android version). Look for the option to “Check for updates” to see if any new software updates are available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off.jpg"                      alt="update software"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-Cool-down-your-phone-to-avoid-your-phone-keeps-turning-off"><a href="#Part-5-Cool-down-your-phone-to-avoid-your-phone-keeps-turning-off" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off"></a>Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off</h2><p>When a phone overheats, it can trigger an automatic shutdown as a protective mechanism to prevent damage to the Motorola Razr 40 device’s internal components. Overheating occurs when the phone’s internal temperature rises significantly, typically due to excessive heat generated by the processor and other hardware components during intensive tasks or prolonged usage.</p><p>To prevent the phone from turning off due to overheating, you can take various measures, such as limiting intensive usage, avoiding direct sunlight and hot environments, and using the phone on hard surfaces to aid heat dissipation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off-1.jpg"                      alt="cool down the phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-Narrow-down-the-randomly-turning-off-issue-in-Safe-Mode"><a href="#Part-6-Narrow-down-the-randomly-turning-off-issue-in-Safe-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode"></a>Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode</h2><p>Starting your phone in Safe Mode is a good way to narrow down whether or not the problem is occurring because of some heavy and incompatible Apps as Safe Mode allows only built-in Apps to function.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Motorola-Moto-G84-5G-Screen-Unresponsive-Here’s-How-to-Fix-It"><a href="#Motorola-Moto-G84-5G-Screen-Unresponsive-Here’s-How-to-Fix-It" class="headerlink" title="Motorola Moto G84 5G Screen Unresponsive? Here’s How to Fix It"></a>Motorola Moto G84 5G Screen Unresponsive? Here’s How to Fix It</h2><p>Motorola Moto G84 5G phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a <strong>Motorola Moto G84 5G touch screen not working</strong>, which can be frustrating and difficult.</p><p>This article aims to provide solutions for Motorola Moto G84 5G phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your <strong>Motorola Moto G84 5G touchscreen is not working</strong>, don’t worry – we’ve got you covered!</p><h2 id="What-Causes-A-Motorola-Moto-G84-5G-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#What-Causes-A-Motorola-Moto-G84-5G-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="What Causes A Motorola Moto G84 5G Screen Unresponsive?"></a>What Causes A Motorola Moto G84 5G Screen Unresponsive?</h2><p>There are several reasons why a Motorola Moto G84 5G phone’s screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It’s essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.</p><p>Below are some possible causes of Motorola Moto G84 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Soft-bricked software:</strong> Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Motorola Moto G84 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Motorola Moto G84 5G device unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment is worn out:</strong> Hardware problems can also cause Motorola Moto G84 5G screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Motorola Moto G84 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.</p></li><li><p>**Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Motorola Moto G84 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.</p></li></ul><h2 id="The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Motorola-Moto-G84-5G-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Motorola-Moto-G84-5G-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="The Common Solutions To Solve A Motorola Moto G84 5G Screen Unresponsive"></a>The Common Solutions To Solve A Motorola Moto G84 5G Screen Unresponsive</h2><p>In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Motorola Moto G84 5G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Motorola Moto G84 5G model.</p><h3 id="1-Restart-The-Device"><a href="#1-Restart-The-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart The Device"></a>1. Restart The Device</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mui restart button"                ></p><p>Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Motorola Moto G84 5G black screen problem. It’s a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone’s memory.</p><p>It is the most commonly used method to fix Motorola Moto G84 5G’s touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Motorola Moto G84 5G device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Motorola Moto G84 5G device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Motorola Moto G84 5Glogo appears.</p><h3 id="2-Leave-The-Phone-And-Let-The-Battery-Drain-Completely"><a href="#2-Leave-The-Phone-And-Let-The-Battery-Drain-Completely" class="headerlink" title="2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely"></a>2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg"                      alt="low battery"                ></p><p>Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Motorola Moto G84 5G device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Motorola Moto G84 5G device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Motorola Moto G84 5G device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.</p><h3 id="3-Contact-Custom-Service"><a href="#3-Contact-Custom-Service" class="headerlink" title="3. Contact Custom Service"></a>3. Contact Custom Service</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi contact customer service"                ></p><p>If restarting the Motorola Moto G84 5G device or allowing the battery to drain doesn’t resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Motorola Moto G84 5G device in for repair or replacement. It’s important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.</p><p>In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Motorola Moto G84 5G Y2 and Motorola Moto G84 5G 5A.</p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Device-Performance"><a href="#4-Optimize-Device-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Device Performance"></a>4. Optimize Device Performance</h3><p>One solution is to optimize the Motorola Moto G84 5G device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features.

However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.</p><ol start="2"><li>How do you fix a boot loop?</li></ol><p>When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.</p><p>For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup. You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.</p><ol start="3"><li>How to prevent a boot loop?</li></ol><p>A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle. Most issues are software-related, such as having to do a system upgrade gone wrong or a problem that doesn’t mesh. One way to prevent this is to perform a software or system upgrade constantly. Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>3,405,439</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article summarizes some of the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.

Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:</p><ul><li><strong>Router Problems</strong></li></ul><p>If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.</p><ul><li><strong>Out of Wi-Fi Range</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Why does My Motorola Moto G84 5G keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi</strong>? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.</p><ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked</strong></li></ul><p>The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.</p><ul><li><strong>Devices Connected with Router</strong></li></ul><p>Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Unstable Internet</strong></li></ul><p>If your Motorola Moto G84 5G gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.</p><p>Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects.

Sometimes, it’s the phone that’s causing a problem, so to resolve it, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Firstly, unlock your phone. Now, press the Power button and hold it for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, select the ‘Reboot’ option to resolve the issue from the options on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-1.jpg"                      alt="select reboot option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings"><a href="#Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Check Router Settings"></a>Fix 2: Check Router Settings</h3><p>If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings.

This could be done easily by following the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on your wifi option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: A list of all the Wi-Fi networks will appear on the screen. Select the network that is causing trouble from that list and hit the ‘Forget Network’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-4.jpg"                      alt="click on forgot network"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: After that, you should reconnect to this Wi-Fi network by selecting it from the Wi-Fi list and entering its password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-5.jpg"                      alt="enter wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router"><a href="#Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Restart Your Router"></a>Fix 4: Restart Your Router</h3><p>As we discussed, to restart your phone, you can also restart the router to get rid of the problem. For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start. If the Motorola Moto G84 5G device has no button, disconnect the power supply and plug it back in to connect again. Most internet issues are resolved by restarting the router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-6.jpg"                      alt="restart wifi router"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks"><a href="#Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Forget Old Networks"></a>Fix 5: Forget Old Networks</h3><p>The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-7.jpg"                      alt="open wifi settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You will see a list of all the Wi-Fi networks you have connected to previously.

Check Recently Installed Applications"></a>Fix 6. Check Recently Installed Applications</h3><p>Sometimes, different installed applications can also cause trouble. If your Wi-Fi was fine, but suddenly it started disconnecting, then don’t forget to check the recently installed apps. This is because with not knowing the damage it can cause, you might have installed some VPNs, connections boosters, or firewalls. You can try and disable them but if that doesn’t resolve the problem, then uninstall the app.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: For uninstalling the problematic application, you have to select it and hold it. You will see a pop-up menu of multiple options; choose the option of ‘Uninstall’ to remove the app from the phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-9.jpg"                      alt="tap on uninstall button"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>It’s annoying that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting while you are working or studying.

Today, we’re going to share with you the complete definitive guide to help you get your Motorola Moto G84 5G connected and free from problems and issues.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Restart-your-Motorola-Moto-G84-5G"><a href="#Part-1-Restart-your-Motorola-Moto-G84-5G" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Restart your Motorola Moto G84 5G"></a>Part 1: Restart your Motorola Moto G84 5G</h2><p>Begin by powering off your Motorola Moto G84 5G and unplugging your router. Wait for about a minute before plugging in the router and turning on your device. This simple reset can often restore stable connections and fix Android wifi not working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android.jpg"                      alt="restart android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Turn-on-Airplane-mode-and-turn-off"><a href="#Part-2-Turn-on-Airplane-mode-and-turn-off" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Turn on Airplane mode and turn off"></a>Part 2: Turn on Airplane mode and turn off</h2><p>Turn on Airplane Mode for a few seconds, then turn it off.

Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.</p><p>However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.</p><ol><li>Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights</li><li>While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem</li><li>Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again</li><li>Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area</li><li>Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Motorola Moto G84 5G is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Boot-your-Android-in-safe-mode"><a href="#Part-4-Boot-your-Android-in-safe-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.</p><p>The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Motorola Moto G84 5G, but the basic process goes as follows;</p><ol><li>Turn off your Motorola Moto G84 5G by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Motorola Moto G84 5G device is completely off</li><li>Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time</li><li>You will see the words ‘Safe Mode’ appear on your screen as the Motorola Moto G84 5G device loads</li><li>Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works</li></ol><p>If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, you’ll know you have a problem with an app or service that’s running on your device. If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Check-the-Android-Wi-Fi-adapter"><a href="#Part-5-Check-the-Android-Wi-Fi-adapter" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

This could be an adapter on your Motorola Moto G84 5G itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.</p><p>You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.</p><ol><li>If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Motorola Moto G84 5G device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection</li><li>If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Motorola Moto G84 5G is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords.

Check SSID and IP address on Android</h2><p>To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Motorola Moto G84 5G needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.</p><p>Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Motorola Moto G84 5G. Here’s how to check on your Motorola Moto G84 5G to make sure everything is correct.</p><ol><li>Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Motorola Moto G84 5G</li><li>Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router</li><li>Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router</li><li>Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address.

Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="camera not working error in android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?"></a>Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Motorola Moto G84 5G.</p><p><strong>Low Memory</strong></p><p>Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.</p><p><strong>Low Storage</strong></p><p>The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Motorola Moto G84 5G. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Motorola Moto G84 5G right where you are, without needing to take the Motorola Moto G84 5G device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Motorola Moto G84 5G device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera and tap Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache android"                ></p><h3 id="II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache"><a href="#II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache"></a>II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache</h3><p>The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg"                      alt="google play store app updates"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg"                      alt="check for app updates play store"                ></p><p>Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.</p><h3 id="II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down"><a href="#II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down" class="headerlink" title="II.VII: Cool The Phone Down"></a>II.VII: Cool The Phone Down</h3><p>We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.</p><p>If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.</p><h3 id="II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System"><a href="#II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System" class="headerlink" title="II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System"></a>II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System</h3><p>You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.</p><h3 id="II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)"></a>II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)</h3><p>Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre.

If you find any damage, you may need to take your phone to a professional repair shop or consider getting a replacement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-04.jpg"                      alt="phone with damaged screen from dropping"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> If you have a screen protector or case, remove them because they can interfere with the process. This step will allow you to get a clear view of the screen and accurately assess the <strong><strong>dead pixel on the phone</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-05.jpg"                      alt="smartphone and a screen protector"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Remove any gloves you may be wearing and any stickers placed over the screen or sensors. Gloves and stickers can interfere with the touchscreen and affect the accuracy of fixing the <strong><strong>broken pixels on the phone</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> Finally, ensure that your screen is clean and free from any smudges or dirt that could affect the accuracy of fixing <strong><strong>dead pixels on the phone</strong></strong>. You can use a microfiber cloth to clean your screen gently, making sure not to apply too much pressure or use any harsh chemicals that could damage the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-06.jpg"                      alt="wiping phone screen with clean cloth"                ></p><h3 id="Option-2-Restart-Your-Motorola-Moto-G84-5G"><a href="#Option-2-Restart-Your-Motorola-Moto-G84-5G" class="headerlink" title="Option 2: Restart Your Motorola Moto G84 5G"></a>Option 2: Restart Your Motorola Moto G84 5G</h3><p>This method may seem simple, but it can be the most effective solution to your problem.

Sometimes, stuck pixels may only show up when using particular apps, so identifying which app is causing the issue can help pinpoint the problem.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Put your smartphone in <strong><strong>Safe Mode</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Visit the help page for your device’s manufacturer to learn how to activate and deactivate safe mode. Safe mode disables all downloaded programs momentarily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-08.jpg"                      alt="safe mode on the android screen"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the <strong><strong>stuck pixel phone</strong></strong> display. Next, turn off <strong><strong>Safe Mode</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.</p><h3 id="Option-4-Perform-Factory-Data-Reset"><a href="#Option-4-Perform-Factory-Data-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset"></a>Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset</h3><p>Consider a factory data reset if the previous options did not resolve your issue with stuck or dead pixels on the phone screen.

Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail</h2><p>If an incoming call to your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:</p><ol><li>Turn Off Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode</li></ol><p>DND mode is a feature that silences all incoming calls, notifications, and alerts. If DND mode is enabled, your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone calls. To turn off DND mode, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification settings panel, then tap the <strong>Do not disturb</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-02.jpg"                      alt="do not disturb mode not enabled"                ></p><p>Here’s an alternative way:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Notifications</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Do not disturb</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-03.jpg"                      alt="notifications settings interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> offto disable the mode.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Turn Off Call Forwarding</li></ol><p>One reason calls go <strong>straight to voicemail without ringing</strong> is if you enabled call forwarding.

It is a feature that restricts calls from being made or received on your phone. If activated, it can cause incoming calls to a phone to go straight to voicemail. To turn off call barring on Motorola Moto G84 5G devices:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone Dialer</strong> app, then tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Supplementary services</strong> &gt; <strong>Call barring</strong>, then tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>Voice call</strong>, then turn off your preferred outgoing and incoming calls.

Airplane Mode turns off all wireless connections on your phone, including cellular service, which can cause calls to <strong>dial straight to voicemail</strong>. There are two ways to turn off Airplane mode on Android:</p><p>Using the Settings app:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Network &amp; internet</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong>.</li></ul><p>Using the Quick Settings panel:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Swipe down from the top of the phone screen to access the <strong>Quick Settings</strong> panel.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for the <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong> icon, then tap it to turn it off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-11.jpg"                      alt="airplane mode on"                ></p><ol start="8"><li>Check Blocked Numbers</li></ol><p><strong>“My boyfriend’s phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone is calling. Any idea why that might be?”</p><p>Do you also find yourself asking what does it mean? It could be that he has blocked that phone number. To check this:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone dialer</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Block numbers</strong>. If you find the number in the blocked list, remove it to ensure that their calls come through to the phone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-12.jpg"                      alt="block numbers on the phone"                ></p><p>If you still have trouble reaching your boyfriend, try calling him from a different number. If your call didn’t go through, you know that he hasn’t blocked your number and that there may be another issue with his phone.</p><ol start="9"><li>Turn Off Google One VPN</li></ol><p>If you’re using Google One VPN, try turning it off to see if that fixes the problem. Some users have reported that Google One VPN can cause incoming calls to a <strong>phone to go straight to voicemail</strong>. To turn off Google One VPN:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Google One</strong> app on your Motorola Moto G84 5G.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> At the bottom, go to the <strong>Benefits</strong> tab, then tap <strong>View Details</strong> below the <strong>Online protection with a VPN</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-13.jpg"                      alt="google one app interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Enable VPN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-14.jpg"                      alt="turn off google one vpn"                ></p><ol start="10"><li>Contact Your Carrier</li></ol><p>If your <strong>phone calls go straight to voicemail</strong> after trying all the above, contact your carrier for help. They may be able to troubleshoot the problem or determine if there is a service outage in your area.</p><p>And if your carrier confirms that there is no service outage or billing-related block, the problem may be with your phone itself. You may need to try resetting your phone to factory settings or taking it to a repair shop.</p><ol start="11"><li>The Caller Used Ringless Voicemail</li></ol><p>Ringless voicemail is a service that allows businesses to bypass your phone’s ringtone and send you pre-recorded messages directly to voicemail. Ringless voicemail is often used for marketing purposes. If you think you’re receiving ringless voicemail calls, you can contact the company calling you and ask them to remove you from their list.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Not-Clear-About-the-Root-Cause-Troubleshoot-Directly-by-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-2-Not-Clear-About-the-Root-Cause-Troubleshoot-Directly-by-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Not Clear About the Root Cause?

Understanding the underlying causes of the “Android App Not Installed” error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:</p><p>1. Insufficient storage</p><p>Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.</p><p>2. Corrupted&#x2F;Contaminated App file</p><p>When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.</p><p>3. SD Card not mounted in the Motorola Moto G34 5G device</p><p>At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.</p><p>4. Storage location</p><p>You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Motorola Moto G34 5G device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn’t installed because of an unknown Error Code.</p><p>5. Corrupt storage</p><p>Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn’t installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.</p><p>6. Application Permission</p><p>Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.</p><p>7.

There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Motorola Moto G34 5G device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Motorola Moto G34 5G, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Motorola-Moto-G34-5G-Not-Connecting-to-Wi-Fi-12-Quick-Ways-to-Fix"><a href="#Motorola-Moto-G34-5G-Not-Connecting-to-Wi-Fi-12-Quick-Ways-to-Fix" class="headerlink" title="Motorola Moto G34 5G Not Connecting to Wi-Fi? 12 Quick Ways to Fix"></a>Motorola Moto G34 5G Not Connecting to Wi-Fi? 12 Quick Ways to Fix</h2><p>Nowadays, it’s pretty much essential to have your Motorola Moto G34 5G or smartphone connected to the internet. Whether you’re watching videos, looking something up, or using any kind of app, you need the internet for these applications to function correctly.</p><p>This is why it can so annoying when it gets to a point where the internet connection isn’t working. However, the problem of a web page not loading correctly is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>There are plenty of problems you could experience, whether it’s the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/why-does-my-phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi.html" >Wi-Fi network keeps disconnecting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on its own without any warning, perhaps a security issue where the passcode or IP address isn’t being registered properly, or even if the connection is just being super slow, even if there’s no reason too.</p><p>Luckily, despite there being so many problems out there, there are also many solutions. Today, we’re going to share with you the complete definitive guide to help you get your Motorola Moto G34 5G connected and free from problems and issues.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Restart-your-Motorola-Moto-G34-5G"><a href="#Part-1-Restart-your-Motorola-Moto-G34-5G" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Restart your Motorola Moto G34 5G"></a>Part 1: Restart your Motorola Moto G34 5G</h2><p>Begin by powering off your Motorola Moto G34 5G and unplugging your router. Wait for about a minute before plugging in the router and turning on your device. This simple reset can often restore stable connections and fix Android wifi not working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android.jpg"                      alt="restart android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Turn-on-Airplane-mode-and-turn-off"><a href="#Part-2-Turn-on-Airplane-mode-and-turn-off" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Turn on Airplane mode and turn off"></a>Part 2: Turn on Airplane mode and turn off</h2><p>Turn on Airplane Mode for a few seconds, then turn it off. This maneuver refreshes your device’s network connections and might rectify the Android not connecting to wifi issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android-1.jpg"                      alt="turn on airplane mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Wi-Fi-Router-settings"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Wi-Fi-Router-settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings"></a>Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings</h2><p>The third step you’ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Motorola Moto G34 5G. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.</p><p>However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.</p><ol><li>Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights</li><li>While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem</li><li>Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again</li><li>Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area</li><li>Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Motorola Moto G34 5G is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Boot-your-Android-in-safe-mode"><a href="#Part-4-Boot-your-Android-in-safe-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode"></a>Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg"                      alt="wifi not working on android - safe mode"                ></p><p>If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Motorola Moto G34 5G itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.</p><p>The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Motorola Moto G34 5G, but the basic process goes as follows;</p><ol><li>Turn off your Motorola Moto G34 5G by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Motorola Moto G34 5G device is completely off</li><li>Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time</li><li>You will see the words ‘Safe Mode’ appear on your screen as the Motorola Moto G34 5G device loads</li><li>Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works</li></ol><p>If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, you’ll know you have a problem with an app or service that’s running on your device. If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Check-the-Android-Wi-Fi-adapter"><a href="#Part-5-Check-the-Android-Wi-Fi-adapter" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter"></a>Part 5.

This could be an adapter on your Motorola Moto G34 5G itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.</p><p>You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.</p><ol><li>If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Motorola Moto G34 5G device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection</li><li>If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Motorola Moto G34 5G is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords.

This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Motorola Moto G34 5G.

There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Motorola Moto G34 5G right where you are, without needing to take the Motorola Moto G34 5G device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Motorola Moto G34 5G device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera and tap Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache android"                ></p><h3 id="II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache"><a href="#II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache"></a>II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache</h3><p>The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg"                      alt="google play store app updates"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg"                      alt="check for app updates play store"                ></p><p>Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.</p><h3 id="II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down"><a href="#II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down" class="headerlink" title="II.VII: Cool The Phone Down"></a>II.VII: Cool The Phone Down</h3><p>We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.</p><p>If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.</p><h3 id="II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System"><a href="#II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System" class="headerlink" title="II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System"></a>II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System</h3><p>You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.</p><h3 id="II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)"></a>II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)</h3><p>Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre.

You’ll be logged out of all your accounts and won’t have access to your message history, contacts, and more.</p><p>While it seems like an extreme step, it can help fix any video issues you might encounter due to software bugs.</p><p>Though there could be slight variations between different phones, you can usually perform a factory reset by going to <strong>Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Factory data reset &gt; Reset.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-4.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Restart-Your-Motorola-Moto-G34-5G"><a href="#2-Restart-Your-Motorola-Moto-G34-5G" class="headerlink" title="2. Restart Your Motorola Moto G34 5G"></a>2. Restart Your Motorola Moto G34 5G</h3><p>While a factory reset is all but guaranteed to fix the issues you’re encountering with your videos, sometimes a simple restart might do the trick just fine. A restart works by clearing your RAM (Random Access Memory).</p><p>In a nutshell, RAM stores short-term data that helps your processor complete tasks quickly. This data is always easily accessible, and it’s what helps your phone quickly open webpages and apps you’ve recently used.</p><p>Over time, however, your RAM can get filled with unnecessary data and data fragments, which, in turn, can confuse your processor.</p><p>Restarting your phone will clear your RAM and potentially eliminate any data fragments causing your videos to be unplayable.</p><h3 id="3-Check-the-Video-Format"><a href="#3-Check-the-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the Video Format"></a>3. Check the Video Format</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb, the videos you capture should be in a format your device supports. However, the videos you’ve downloaded might not be. That’s why checking the files’ video format before trying other possible fixes is in your best interest.</p><p>If the format isn’t supported, installing the right video player with the necessary compatibility is the most straightforward fix. Some of the most popular video players for Android include VLC for Android, GOM Player, MX Player, Bsplayer, and RealPlayer. You can easily find all of them in the Google Play Store.</p><h3 id="4-Check-the-Internet-Connection"><a href="#4-Check-the-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="4. Check the Internet Connection"></a>4. Check the Internet Connection</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-5.jpg"                      alt="pull-down bar on android showing wifi is turned off"                ></p><p>If you’re having problems playing downloaded or online videos, check your internet connection to see if there’s an issue there.

Not every update is there simply to introduce new features.</p><p>To check whether you’re using the latest version of your video player, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Apps</strong>. Find your video player app, tap it, and scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the version installed on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-14.jpg"                      alt="android app version"                ></p><h3 id="9-Clear-Cookies-and-Browsing-Data"><a href="#9-Clear-Cookies-and-Browsing-Data" class="headerlink" title="9. Clear Cookies and Browsing Data"></a>9. Clear Cookies and Browsing Data</h3><p>If online videos are causing problems, not your recorded or downloaded ones, you might be due for a quick cookie and browsing data clearing.</p><p>Cookies are usually there to improve the user experience, allowing you to load websites faster and enjoy improved performance. However, if your cookies and browsing data occupy too much space, they could pose problems.</p><p>You’ll first need to launch your mobile browser to clear cookies and browsing data. If you’re using Google Chrome, the process is simple and streamlined. Tap the three dots in the upper right corner and go to <strong>Settings</strong>. From there, go to <strong>Privacy and security &gt; Clear browsing data &gt; Clear data</strong>.</p><h3 id="10-Reinstall-Video-Apps"><a href="#10-Reinstall-Video-Apps" class="headerlink" title="10. Reinstall Video Apps"></a>10. Reinstall Video Apps</h3><p>If you still have issues with videos not playing on your Motorola Moto G34 5G, you could try deleting and reinstalling your video apps. Sometimes, simply updating the video app might still retain the glitch causing problems. However, if you delete it in its entirety and then install it again, the issue should be gone.</p><p>To uninstall the video app on your Android, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Apps</strong>. Locate the app you want to delete, then tap <strong>Uninstall</strong> at the bottom of your screen.</p><p>To reinstall it again, go to the Google Play Store, search for the video app you want to have, then click <strong>Install</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>4,974,400</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Like other smartphones, Android devices occasionally encounter glitches when playing video files.

An “Application not installed” error message usually pops up when you are trying to download and install an App with a .apk file extension from somewhere other than the Google Play Store. The error is very confusing at first but makes sense when you realize that this unknown Error Code during Application installation is neither a software issue nor a hardware problem. It is a direct outcome of what you do with your device. Yes, you heard that right. Your faulty actions can cause Android App not installed error.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/app-not-installed-error-in-android.jpg"                      alt="app not install on android"                ></p><p>What to do when trying to install the Android APK it says “app not installed”? It is terrible that you can’t install App on your device. But in this article, you will know more about the causes behind this error and the best ways to fix it, read on, here is all you need to know.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error"><a href="#Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error"></a>Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error</h2><p>You may ask: Why can’t I download apps on my Motorola Moto G23? Understanding the underlying causes of the “Android App Not Installed” error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:</p><p>1. Insufficient storage</p><p>Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.</p><p>2. Corrupted&#x2F;Contaminated App file</p><p>When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.</p><p>3. SD Card not mounted in the Motorola Moto G23 device</p><p>At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.</p><p>4. Storage location</p><p>You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Motorola Moto G23 device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn’t installed because of an unknown Error Code.</p><p>5. Corrupt storage</p><p>Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn’t installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.</p><p>6. Application Permission</p><p>Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.</p><p>7. Incorrect file</p><p>If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.</p><p>The Unknown Error Code during Application installation can occur due to any one or more of the reasons stated above. So read them carefully and understand them well to avoid such glitches in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994439892909.jpg"                      alt="application not installed" title="application not installed"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error"></a>Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error</h2><p>So App not installed on your Motorola Moto G23 or tablet?

Here’s How to Fix It"></a>Motorola Moto G23 Screen Unresponsive? Here’s How to Fix It</h2><p>Motorola Moto G23 phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a <strong>Motorola Moto G23 touch screen not working</strong>, which can be frustrating and difficult.</p><p>This article aims to provide solutions for Motorola Moto G23 phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your <strong>Motorola Moto G23 touchscreen is not working</strong>, don’t worry – we’ve got you covered!</p><h2 id="What-Causes-A-Motorola-Moto-G23-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#What-Causes-A-Motorola-Moto-G23-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="What Causes A Motorola Moto G23 Screen Unresponsive?"></a>What Causes A Motorola Moto G23 Screen Unresponsive?</h2><p>There are several reasons why a Motorola Moto G23 phone’s screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It’s essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.</p><p>Below are some possible causes of Motorola Moto G23 screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Soft-bricked software:</strong> Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Motorola Moto G23 Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Motorola Moto G23 device unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment is worn out:</strong> Hardware problems can also cause Motorola Moto G23 screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Motorola Moto G23 model, including the Y2 and 5A.</p></li><li><p>**Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Motorola Moto G23 Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.</p></li></ul><h2 id="The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Motorola-Moto-G23-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Motorola-Moto-G23-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="The Common Solutions To Solve A Motorola Moto G23 Screen Unresponsive"></a>The Common Solutions To Solve A Motorola Moto G23 Screen Unresponsive</h2><p>In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Motorola Moto G23 screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Motorola Moto G23 model.</p><h3 id="1-Restart-The-Device"><a href="#1-Restart-The-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart The Device"></a>1. Restart The Device</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mui restart button"                ></p><p>Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Motorola Moto G23 black screen problem. It’s a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone’s memory.</p><p>It is the most commonly used method to fix Motorola Moto G23’s touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Motorola Moto G23 device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Motorola Moto G23 device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Motorola Moto G23logo appears.</p><h3 id="2-Leave-The-Phone-And-Let-The-Battery-Drain-Completely"><a href="#2-Leave-The-Phone-And-Let-The-Battery-Drain-Completely" class="headerlink" title="2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely"></a>2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg"                      alt="low battery"                ></p><p>Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Motorola Moto G23 device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Motorola Moto G23 device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Motorola Moto G23 device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.</p><h3 id="3-Contact-Custom-Service"><a href="#3-Contact-Custom-Service" class="headerlink" title="3. Contact Custom Service"></a>3. Contact Custom Service</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi contact customer service"                ></p><p>If restarting the Motorola Moto G23 device or allowing the battery to drain doesn’t resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Motorola Moto G23 device in for repair or replacement. It’s important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.</p><p>In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Motorola Moto G23 Y2 and Motorola Moto G23 5A.</p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Device-Performance"><a href="#4-Optimize-Device-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Device Performance"></a>4. Optimize Device Performance</h3><p>One solution is to optimize the Motorola Moto G23 device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.</p><p>You can clear your cached data using the default settings.</p><ul><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Storage</strong> &gt; <strong>Cached Data</strong>.</li><li>To clear the cache, select <strong>Clear Cache</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/clear-cached-data-on-xiaomi5a.png"                      alt="clear cached data on xiaomi 5a"                ></p><h3 id="5-Back-Up-And-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Back-Up-And-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Back Up And Factory Reset"></a>5. Back Up And Factory Reset</h3><p>Another solution is to back up the Motorola Moto G23 device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Motorola Moto G23 device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone’s settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Motorola Moto G23 device, so it should only be considered a last resort.</p><p>In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Motorola Moto G23 Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.</p><ul><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to the A<strong>dditional settings</strong> section of the Motorola Moto G23 Redmi 5A settings.</li><li>Please scroll down the screen until you reach the <strong>Backup &amp; reset</strong> option, then click to access it.</li><li>Click<strong>Erase all data (factory reset)</strong> to restore the network settings and applications, or completely reset the Motorola Moto G23 Redmi 5A.</li><li>Select <strong>All files on the phone</strong>to make a complete format of the Motorola Moto G23 Redmi 5A.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/factory-reset-on-xiaomi5a-1.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on xiaomi 5a"                ></p><h3 id="6-Using-Dr-Fone-Repair"><a href="#6-Using-Dr-Fone-Repair" class="headerlink" title="6. Using Dr. Fone Repair"></a>6. Using Dr. Fone Repair</h3><p>If none of the above solutions worked, you can try using Dr. Fone Repair.

Well, some unexpected issue might be there with your Google account. As, there are times where your existing Google account can be the hurdle. Therefore, trying your hand in some other Google account might assist to work things out.</p><h3 id="3-7-Avoid-downloading-large-apps"><a href="#3-7-Avoid-downloading-large-apps" class="headerlink" title="3.7 Avoid downloading large apps"></a>3.7 Avoid downloading large apps</h3><p>Last but certainly not the least, users must avoid downloading large applications. Especially those games that eats a whopping number of 300+MB of your space. You must always watch out on size of the application is and only then craft the decision to load it on your device. This may help out in keeping the <strong><em>Play store stuck on downloading</em></strong> problem at bay.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-solve-youtube-app-crashing-on-oppo-a1-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Solutions to Solve YouTube App Crashing on Oppo A1 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/stuck-at-android-system-recovery-of-xiaomi-redmi-a2plus-fix-it-easily-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Stuck at Android System Recovery Of Xiaomi Redmi A2+ ?

Fix It Now"></a>Motorola Moto G23 Camera Not Working Unexpected Error? Fix It Now</h2><p>For all its glory and goodness, the Android OS often has its users pulling their hair in frustration at just how buggy the OS can be at times. So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today. People only launch the app when they want to take a photo, for everything else there’s a dedicated photo gallery app. What happens when you launch the camera app only to realize it threw an error and you missed your photo moment? Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="camera not working error in android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?"></a>Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Motorola Moto G23.</p><p><strong>Low Memory</strong></p><p>Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.</p><p><strong>Low Storage</strong></p><p>The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Motorola Moto G23. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Motorola Moto G23 right where you are, without needing to take the Motorola Moto G23 device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Motorola Moto G23 device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button.

Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful.

That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably.

We will discuss in this article why your Chrome is crashing on Android and the potential solutions to do away with the problem.

If you keep open the tabs, it may slow down the performance of Chrome and the app will use RAM. As a result, it will obviously get stopped midway. Therefore, we suggest you to close the tabs which are opened. And once you do that, exit the app and then launch it again.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Too-much-memory-used"><a href="#Part-2-Too-much-memory-used" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Too much memory used"></a>Part 2: Too much memory used</h2><p>When Chrome or any other app keeps running on the background, issues like “Unfortunately Chrome has stopped” are likely to occur. Moreover, the opened apps will eat the memory of your device. Hence, as the next solution, it is suggested that the Chrome should be closed by force quitting and then you need to try to launch it again to work. See if it works or still Chrome is not responding.</p><p>1. Simply tap on the Home button twice to get on the recent apps screen. Please note that the button may vary to reach the screen. Please check once and move accordingly.</p><p>2. Now simply swipe the app up&#x2F;left&#x2F;right (according to the Motorola Moto G14 device).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/05/force-quit-chrome.jpg"                      alt="fix Chrome crashing on Android by force quiting"                ></p><p>3.

And when cache is not getting cleared, one may face the freezing, crashing or sluggish apps. And this could also be the cause why your Chrome keeps stopping. Hence, the following steps will show you how to clear cache and make Chrome work as before.</p><p>1. Open “Settings” and go to “Apps &amp; Notifications”.</p><p>2. Look for “Chrome” and tap on it.</p><p>3.

We doubt if the particular website you are making use of is the culprit and making Chrome keeps stopping. In such case, we would like to recommend you to make use of another browser and try to access the website from there. See if this works or not.

Fix It Now"></a>Motorola Moto G14 Camera Not Working Unexpected Error? Fix It Now</h2><p>For all its glory and goodness, the Android OS often has its users pulling their hair in frustration at just how buggy the OS can be at times. So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today. People only launch the app when they want to take a photo, for everything else there’s a dedicated photo gallery app. What happens when you launch the camera app only to realize it threw an error and you missed your photo moment? Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="camera not working error in android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?"></a>Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Motorola Moto G14.</p><p><strong>Low Memory</strong></p><p>Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.</p><p><strong>Low Storage</strong></p><p>The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Motorola Moto G14. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Motorola Moto G14 right where you are, without needing to take the Motorola Moto G14 device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Motorola Moto G14 device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera and tap Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache android"                ></p><h3 id="II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache"><a href="#II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache"></a>II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache</h3><p>The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg"                      alt="google play store app updates"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg"                      alt="check for app updates play store"                ></p><p>Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.</p><h3 id="II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down"><a href="#II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down" class="headerlink" title="II.VII: Cool The Phone Down"></a>II.VII: Cool The Phone Down</h3><p>We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.</p><p>If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.</p><h3 id="II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System"><a href="#II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System" class="headerlink" title="II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System"></a>II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System</h3><p>You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.</p><h3 id="II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)"></a>II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)</h3><p>Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre.

Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong></li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Head into <strong>System</strong>&gt; <strong>System update</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: If there’s an update available, click it and go through the process of updating your phone’s system.</li></ul><p>Restarting your phone after an update, even if it doesn’t restart itself, is highly advisable, ensuring that the new updates apply without issues.</p><h3 id="3-Revert-to-the-Previous-Version"><a href="#3-Revert-to-the-Previous-Version" class="headerlink" title="3. Revert to the Previous Version"></a>3. Revert to the Previous Version</h3><p>As we’ve discussed the wrong Play Services versions above, it’s worth noting that sometimes even the developers can make mistakes and roll out the wrong version for your phone. So, if you notice that the phone is getting the error after you’ve updated Google Services or the Play Store, you can quickly revert to the previous version, and here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Head into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Google Play Services.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Press the <strong>Disable</strong>button at the bottom of the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Restart the phone, repeat the process by clicking <strong>Enable</strong>this time, and restart the phone again.</li></ul><p>As these are system apps, you can’t remove them from the phone, and disabling them will only remove the updates, leaving you with a base version that came with your phone out of the box.</p><h3 id="4-Uninstall-the-App’s-Updates-and-Reinstall"><a href="#4-Uninstall-the-App’s-Updates-and-Reinstall" class="headerlink" title="4. Uninstall the App’s Updates and Reinstall"></a>4. Uninstall the App’s Updates and Reinstall</h3><p>Like reverting to the previous version, you can also try reinstalling updates to fix the Google Play Services has stopped working error. The process is similar to the one above, but we’ve still included the steps. Here’s how you can do that:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> and find <strong>Google Play Services</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Tap it and press <strong>Uninstall Updates</strong>at the bottom.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-3.jpeg"                      alt="uninstall google play services updates"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Exit the <strong>Settings</strong>app and restart the phone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Open the <strong>Play Store</strong>app and head into the app’s settings by clicking your profile icon.

That will ensure that older and not-up-to-date apps aren’t causing the issue.</p><h3 id="5-Check-Storage"><a href="#5-Check-Storage" class="headerlink" title="5. Check Storage"></a>5. Check Storage</h3><p>Believe it or not, one of the leading causes of the Google Play Services issue is a phone overfilled with apps. Namely, if you have insufficient storage, the Google Play Store app will likely crash and display errors such as “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped working.”</p><p>Head into your phone’s Settings and select Storage to see how your phone’s doing storage-wise. Deleting a few apps you don’t use and transferring your photo and video library to a PC is highly advisable if your phone’s storage space lacks gigabytes.</p><h3 id="6-Do-a-System-Repair"><a href="#6-Do-a-System-Repair" class="headerlink" title="6. Do a System Repair"></a>6. Do a System Repair</h3><p>Although the other solutions here are general fixes that might help, a system repair might take a bit longer but will undoubtedly fix your issue.

Once it’s done, your Google Play Services app will undoubtedly work.</p><h3 id="7-Clear-Cache"><a href="#7-Clear-Cache" class="headerlink" title="7. Clear Cache"></a>7. Clear Cache</h3><p>The easiest and the most obvious fix for many Android apps is clearing the app’s cache. Here’s how you can do that for Google Play Services and Google Play Store:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> and find the <strong>Google Play Store</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Tap <strong>Storage</strong>and hit the <strong>Clear cache</strong></p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-10.jpg"                      alt="clear app cache"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Repeat the process for the <strong>Google Play Services</strong></p></li></ul><p>If this doesn’t work, move on to another possible fix.</p><h3 id="8-Check-Date-and-Time-Settings"><a href="#8-Check-Date-and-Time-Settings" class="headerlink" title="8. Check Date and Time Settings"></a>8. Check Date and Time Settings</h3><p>Oddly enough, the Google Play Services app is prone to failure because of an incorrectly set time or date. That’s because Google’s servers constantly check these settings before issuing updates to the Motorola Moto G14 devices, so you’ll need to ensure they’re correct beforehand. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Head into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Date &amp; Time</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Ensure that both “**<em>Use network–provided time</em><strong>” and “</strong><em>Use network-provided time zone</em>**” are toggled on.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-11.jpg"                      alt="check date and time settings"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If this doesn’t work, you can try repeating the process and manually setting the time and the time zone.</p></li></ul><p>Once you check or change these settings, try using the Google Play Store app and check whether the issue is fixed. Restarting the phone after changing the settings is also highly advisable.</p><h3 id="9-Troubleshoot-Your-Internet-Connection"><a href="#9-Troubleshoot-Your-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="9. Troubleshoot Your Internet Connection"></a>9. Troubleshoot Your Internet Connection</h3><p>Another regularly overlooked troublemaker is a poor internet connection. That’s because most apps nowadays are meant to work in online mode only, and losing connection or using a bad one interferes with the app’s functionality.</p><p>To test the internet connection on your Motorola Moto G14, you should open a browser and head to a random internet page to see if it’s opening and whether there are any delays. If it’s working fine, your internet connection isn’t the problem.</p><h3 id="10-Adjust-Google-Play-Services-Permissions"><a href="#10-Adjust-Google-Play-Services-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="10. Adjust Google Play Services Permissions"></a>10. Adjust Google Play Services Permissions</h3><p>Although permissions rarely change, they can cause issues if you change them accidentally. These settings can be found in the same place where you would uninstall updates or clear the app’s cache, so you can use some of the steps mentioned above to check them.</p><p>Once inside Permission Settings, check whether the Google Play Services and Play Store apps have sufficient permission to do their jobs and whether any required permissions were recently removed. If so, grant these two apps their permissions back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>4,953,228</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although it’s an incredibly frustrating error, the “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped” message is more annoying than serious. We’ve explained why it happens, but we’ve also given you a list of solutions to fix it.</p><p>Our list includes various fixes, from simple ones, like deleting the app’s cache and ensuring your network works fine, to more serious ones, like doing a factory reset.

Connect your Motorola Moto G13 to the computer and choose the Android Repair mode, and hit the Start button to begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="fix android not receiving texts with Dr.Fone"                ></p><p>Step 2: You will have to provide information about your device, including the brand, name, model, country, and carrier. In between, you will be notified that your device repair might erase the existing data of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-2.png"                      alt="android not receiving texts - provide info"                ></p><p>Step 3: Agree with the conditions and hit the Next button.

Now you will be able to receive and send text messages without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM"></a>Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM</h2><p>The easiest thing that you can try if your Motorola Moto G13 is not receiving any text messages is because the SIM is not inserted right. If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can’t receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Check Network Connection"></a>Part 3: Check Network Connection</h2><p>Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Motorola Moto G13 phone is to check your network connection. Usually, you can see the bar on the top of the screen. Maybe the problem exists because you have no signal strength at the moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/no-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check connection"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan"><a href="#Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan"></a>Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan</h2><p>Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Motorola Moto G13s because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Motorola Moto G13 is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot"><a href="#Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot"></a>Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot</h2><p>Sometimes, people complain that Motorola Moto G13 is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.</p><p>When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Motorola Moto G13 device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Motorola Moto G13, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages.

Whether you’re watching videos, looking something up, or using any kind of app, you need the internet for these applications to function correctly.</p><p>This is why it can so annoying when it gets to a point where the internet connection isn’t working. However, the problem of a web page not loading correctly is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>There are plenty of problems you could experience, whether it’s the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/why-does-my-phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi.html" >Wi-Fi network keeps disconnecting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on its own without any warning, perhaps a security issue where the passcode or IP address isn’t being registered properly, or even if the connection is just being super slow, even if there’s no reason too.</p><p>Luckily, despite there being so many problems out there, there are also many solutions. Today, we’re going to share with you the complete definitive guide to help you get your Motorola Moto G13 connected and free from problems and issues.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Restart-your-Motorola-Moto-G13"><a href="#Part-1-Restart-your-Motorola-Moto-G13" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Restart your Motorola Moto G13"></a>Part 1: Restart your Motorola Moto G13</h2><p>Begin by powering off your Motorola Moto G13 and unplugging your router. Wait for about a minute before plugging in the router and turning on your device. This simple reset can often restore stable connections and fix Android wifi not working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android.jpg"                      alt="restart android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Turn-on-Airplane-mode-and-turn-off"><a href="#Part-2-Turn-on-Airplane-mode-and-turn-off" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Turn on Airplane mode and turn off"></a>Part 2: Turn on Airplane mode and turn off</h2><p>Turn on Airplane Mode for a few seconds, then turn it off. This maneuver refreshes your device’s network connections and might rectify the Android not connecting to wifi issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android-1.jpg"                      alt="turn on airplane mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Wi-Fi-Router-settings"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Wi-Fi-Router-settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings"></a>Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings</h2><p>The third step you’ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Motorola Moto G13. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.</p><p>However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.</p><ol><li>Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights</li><li>While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem</li><li>Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again</li><li>Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area</li><li>Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Motorola Moto G13 is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Boot-your-Android-in-safe-mode"><a href="#Part-4-Boot-your-Android-in-safe-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode"></a>Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg"                      alt="wifi not working on android - safe mode"                ></p><p>If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Motorola Moto G13 itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.</p><p>The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Motorola Moto G13, but the basic process goes as follows;</p><ol><li>Turn off your Motorola Moto G13 by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Motorola Moto G13 device is completely off</li><li>Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time</li><li>You will see the words ‘Safe Mode’ appear on your screen as the Motorola Moto G13 device loads</li><li>Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works</li></ol><p>If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, you’ll know you have a problem with an app or service that’s running on your device. If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Check-the-Android-Wi-Fi-adapter"><a href="#Part-5-Check-the-Android-Wi-Fi-adapter" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter"></a>Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg"                      alt="wifi not working on android - check adapter"                ></p><p>If you’re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, you’ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Motorola Moto G13 itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.</p><p>You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.</p><ol><li>If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Motorola Moto G13 device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection</li><li>If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Motorola Moto G13 is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there</li><li>Whichever method you’re using, try disconnecting your Motorola Moto G13 and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection</li></ol><h2 id="Part-6-Check-SSID-and-IP-address-on-Android"><a href="#Part-6-Check-SSID-and-IP-address-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android"></a>Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android</h2><p>To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Motorola Moto G13 needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.</p><p>Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Motorola Moto G13. Here’s how to check on your Motorola Moto G13 to make sure everything is correct.</p><ol><li>Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Motorola Moto G13</li><li>Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router</li><li>Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router</li><li>Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches</li></ol><p>When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Fix-Android-system-issues-in-one-click"><a href="#Part-7-Fix-Android-system-issues-in-one-click" class="headerlink" title="Part 7.

It is very common to see a brick smartphone these days. If you are wondering what exactly is a bricked phone, here is your answer.</p><p>A bricked phone, hard brick or soft brick, is a smartphone which refuses to start or boot all the way up the home&#x2F;main screen of the Motorola Moto G13 device. This issue is observed within most Android phones because users have a tendency to tamper with the Motorola Moto G13 device settings, flashing new and customized ROMs and tweaking with the essential files. Playing around with the phone’s internal set-up leads to such errors, worst of them being a brick smartphone. Usually, a bricked phone does not switch on and stays frozen at the Motorola Moto G13 device logo, a blank screen or even worse, doesn’t respond to any command, even the power on command.</p><p>If you are confused about the soft brick and hard brick problems and looking for solutions to fix your priced phone, then here is all you need to know.</p><p>Read on to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?"></a>Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?</h2><p>To begin with, let us understand the basic difference between a soft brick and hard brick issue. Both versions of a bricked phone prevent it from booting but differ in their causes and gravity of the problem.</p><p>A soft-brick problem is caused merely by a software error&#x2F;crash and makes your device switch on automatically every time you manually turn it off. This phenomenon is referred to as Boot Loop. Soft bricked Android phones are not as difficult to fix as the hard bricked Android phones. It is convenient to say that a soft bricked phone only boots up half-way and not fully, whereas a hard bricked device does not switch on at all. A hard brick error is thus caused when the kernel, which is nothing but an interface for the software to communicate with the hardware, is tampered with. A hard bricked phone is not recognized by your PC when plugged in and is a serious problem. It requires troubleshooting techniques and cannot be easily fixed as the soft brick problem.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987188976168.jpeg" alt="hard bricked v/s soft bricked "></p><p>Hard bricked phones are a rare sight, but the soft brick is very common. Given below are ways to fix a soft brick Android phone. The techniques listed here are the best and the most efficient ways to get your phone back to its normal working conditions without losing your important data or damaging your device or its software.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop"><a href="#Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop"></a>Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop</h2><p>This is the first sign of a soft bricked Android phone. Boot Loop is nothing but when your phone does not remain switched off and turns itself on automatically, and freezes at the logo screen or blank screen, every time you manually try to power it off.</p><p>Stuck at boot loop problem can be fixed by clearing your Cache partitions. These partitions are nothing but storage locations for your modem, kernels, system files, drivers and built-in Apps data.</p><p>It is advisable to clear Cache partitions regularly to keep your phone free from such glitches.</p><p>Since the phone refuses to boot, Cache can be cleared from entering into the Recovery Mode. Different Android devices have different ways to put it in recovery mode. Normally pressing the power key and volume down key helps, but you may refer to your phone’s guide for better understanding and then follow the steps given below to clear the cache partition:</p><p>Once you are the recovery mode screen, you will see a number of options as shown in the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987490613783.jpg"                      alt="recovery mode"                ></p><p>Use the volume down key to scroll down and select ”Wipe cache partition” as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987491246838.jpg"                      alt="”Wipe cache partition”"                >&gt;</p><p>After the process is completed, select “Reboot System” which is the first option in the recovery mode screen.</p><p>This method will help you erase all the clogged up and unwanted files. You may loose some App related data, but that is a small price to pay to fix your bricked phone.</p><p>If this method does not boot up your brick smartphone and the problem still persists, there are two more things you can try. Read ahead to find out about them.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Booting-straight-into-recovery-mode"><a href="#Part-3-Booting-straight-into-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Booting straight into recovery mode"></a>Part 3: Booting straight into recovery mode</h2><p>If your bricked phone does not boot up to your Home Screen or Lock screen and instead boots directly into Recovery Mode, there is not much left to do. Booting straight into recovery mode is undoubtedly a soft brick error but it also indicates a possible problem with your current ROM. The only option you have to flash a new ROM to reboot your bricked phone back to its normal functioning.</p><p>To flash a new ROM:</p><p>Firstly, you must root your phone and unlock the Bootloader. Every phone’s mechanism to unlock the bootloader is different, thus, we suggest to refer to your user manual.</p><p>Once the Bootloader is unlocked, take a backup of all your data by selecting “Backup” or “Android” back in recovery mode. The process should not take long and all you need to do is tap “OK” to config backup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191436732.jpg"                      alt="backup and restore"                ></p><p>In this step, download a ROM of your choice and store it in your SD Card. Insert the SD Card in your phone to begin the flashing process.</p><p>Once at the recovery mode, select “Install Zip from SD Card” from the options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191676749.jpg"                      alt="install zip from sdcard"                ></p><p>Scroll down using the volume key and use the power key to select the downloaded ROM.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191926694.jpg"                      alt="Scroll down"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987192218478.jpg"                      alt="select the downloaded ROM"                ></p><p>This might take a few minutes of your time, but once the process is complete, reboot your phone.</p><p>Hopefully, your bricked phone will not boot normally and work smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Booting-straight-into-Bootloader"><a href="#Part-4-Booting-straight-into-Bootloader" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Booting straight into Bootloader"></a>Part 4: Booting straight into Bootloader</h2><p>If your bricked phone boots straight into Bootloader, then this a serious issue and must not be taken lightly.
