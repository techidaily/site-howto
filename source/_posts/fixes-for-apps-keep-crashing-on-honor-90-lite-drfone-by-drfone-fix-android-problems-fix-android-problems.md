## Fixes for Apps Keep Crashing on Honor 90 Lite

The rapid evolution of technology has transformed our smartphones into powerful devices. Presently, with just a few taps, they possess the ability to accomplish a diverse array of tasks. It has been possible due to the extensive availability of mobile applications. However, it can be incredibly frustrating when your favorite apps keep crashing repeatedly.

You're not alone if you're an Android user who encounters app crashes. This article will explore ten practical ways to fix apps that keep crashing on Android devices. We will also discuss the causes behind app crashes and how to prevent them.

## Part 1: What Are the Causes Behind Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

There are many reasons for ****the app crashing**** on Android devices. These reasons range from insufficient storage space to bugs and glitches in the apps. Finding out the root cause of an app crashing is important so that you can find the appropriate solution. Discussed below are some of the reasons why your Android apps keep crashing:

### Insufficient Memory

When a device is low on memory, it may struggle to run multiple apps simultaneously. Each app requires memory to store its data and execute its processes. If the available memory is limited, it can cause apps to crash. That happens because they don't have enough resources to operate properly.

### Software Compatibility

Android devices come in various models and run different operating system versions. That's why it is essential to use apps compatible with your device. Since there are a lot of Android variants, it is hard to optimize apps for all devices. An app not optimized for an Android version or device leads to crashes or malfunctions.

### Outdated Apps

Apps are regularly updated to introduce new features, fix bugs, and enhance performance. Using an outdated version of an app may cause instability or compatibility problems. Since the app is not optimized for the current version of Android, it can keep crashing.

### Network Problems

Some apps rely heavily on network connectivity to function properly. They need a stable and strong internet connection to perform all the functions. These apps can crash if there are network connectivity issues, such as a weak Wi-Fi or network outage. Unstable connections can disrupt data transmission, making the app's function challenging.

### App Bugs

Despite rigorous testing, apps can still have bugs or coding errors that lead to crashes. Bugs in apps can occur due to various reasons. It mostly relates to incorrect implementation of features or unexpected user interactions. App developers work to identify and fix these bugs, often releasing updates.

## Part 2: How to Fix the Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Honor 90 Lite device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**
