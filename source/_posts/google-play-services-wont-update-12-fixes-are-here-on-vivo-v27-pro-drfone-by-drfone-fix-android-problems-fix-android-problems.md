It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Vivo V27 Pro model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Vivo V27 Pro Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Vivo V27 Pro black screen problem.

By restarting the Vivo V27 Pro device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem.
