## How To Restore a Bricked Lava Blaze Pro 5G Back to Operation

In moments of lag or freezing on your Android, you might **brick Your Lava Blaze Pro 5G,** which can be unsettling. This is more than just the loss of a device. A **bricked cell phone** also involves potential data erasure. Yet, it's crucial to understand the true implications of a **bricked phone**. This page tackles how to address the issue of a bricked Android phone.

This comprehensive guide aims to the reasons behind Android phones becoming bricked. By reading below, you'll learn effective methods to **unbrick a mobile phone** without the risk of data loss.

![man holding a bricked phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/how-to-restore-a-bricked-phone-01.jpg)


## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

Below are the common causes why a **cell phone bricks**.

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device's OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. [Rooting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html) often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone's core functionality.

#### Installing Bad Apps

Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation. In severe cases, they can trigger a [boot loop](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/boot-loop-android.html) or render the phone unresponsive.

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.

## Part 2. Unbricking Methods and Tools

Below are solutions that you can employ to fix various brick phone scenarios.

![rebooting a bricked phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/how-to-restore-a-bricked-phone-02.jpg)

### Reverting Android Device to Factory Defaults (Soft Brick)

A universal approach to trying to recover a **brick phone** exists for all Android phones. This is, consider restoring your device to its factory settings. You can find instructions specific to your phone model online. Although this procedure erases all your data, it's possible to regain the use of your brick phone.

### Get in Touch With the Manufacturer (Hard Brick and Soft Brick)

Normally, smartphone warranties span from 1 to 2 years. If your phone remains unrooted and falls within that coverage period, consider reaching out to the manufacturer. This direct approach could lead to your phone being repaired or replaced with a new one at no cost to you.

### Seek Professional Assistance (Hard Brick and Soft Brick)

When your phone falls outside the warranty coverage, consider seeking help from a reputable repair shop. However, be aware that any lost data cannot be attributed to their efforts. Fortunately, you can recover lost data using reliable data recovery software once your phone is operational again.

### Use a Dedicated App To Fix Bricked Mobile Phones (Hard Brick and Soft Brick)

This can happen to various models, such as the Lava Blaze Pro 5G, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Lava Blaze Pro 5G device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Lava Blaze Pro 5G F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Protecting the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
