Also, if you are storing apps on the SD card, then your phone might encounter the process isn’t responding issue whenever you run a respective app. Therefore, you should move apps from your SD card to the phone’s internal memory. To do this, go to your phone’s Settings > Application Manager and select any app. If the app is stored on the SD card, then you will get an option of “Move to devise storage”. Just tap on it and manually move every app to your device storage.
