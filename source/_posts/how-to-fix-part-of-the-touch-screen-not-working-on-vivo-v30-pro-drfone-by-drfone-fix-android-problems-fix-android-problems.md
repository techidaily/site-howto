You probably touch the screen of your phone hundreds of times per day. It’s no surprise that smartphone touchscreens are one of the most common components to fail, given their delicate glass construction. However, a ****part of the touch screen not working**** on your Vivo V30 Pro does not necessarily mean it is a hardware issue. There could be other reasons why your Android’s touch screen stopped responding.

If your phone’s touchscreen frequently fails to respond, there are several things you can try before calling a professional. This article will reveal those proven fixes you can easily perform independently.

## Part 1. Why Is Part of My Screen Not Working

There are two possible causes as to why your phone’s touch screen is not working. One is the touch screen may have been damaged, and the other is the Vivo V30 Pro device may be experiencing technical difficulties.

If you drop your phone and it becomes stuck against something, the touch screen’s connectivity may fail. Only a part of the touch screen may sometimes become damaged and unresponsive. That may also occur when there is a technical failure, such as the phone hanging. A ****part of the touch screen not working**** can occur when malware is downloaded or when phone settings are changed.

Now, the problem can affect any Android phone, and users may encounter the following error messages on their respective phone models:

- Vivo V30 Pro P40 lite ****half touch screen not working****
- Nexus touch screen not working
- LG screen is unresponsive to touch
- Vivo V30 Pro ****left side of the screen is not working****
- Redmi’s whole screen is unresponsive to touch

- Your touches do not register on the touch screen.
- The touch screen incorrectly responds to your touch.
- ****Half touch screen is not working****.
- The touch screen becomes frozen or hangs.
- The screen flashes, flickers, or remains blank.
- The****left side of the phone screen is not working****.

Before proceeding to how to fix an unresponsive touch screen on an Android device, you should complete the following steps:

- Examine the screen of your device. Check to see if it is cracked or chipped.
- If the screen is damaged, it must be replaced.
- Remove the Vivo V30 Pro device cover and screen protector if they are not damaged.
- If there is a sticker on the Vivo V30 Pro device screen, you must remove it.
- Before continuing, make sure your screen is spotless.

## Part 3. How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working (No Physical Damage)

If you have already tried running the Vivo V30 Pro device in diagnostic mode and verified that it is not physically damaged, then the problem is most likely technical. If your Vivo V30 Pro’s screen is not responding to touches for technical reasons, follow the methods below to resolve the issue.

### Restart Your Device

When your touch screen stops working, the first thing you should do is restart your device. The operation is known as soft resetting. You cannot turn your device off from the option on the screen because the touch screen is not responding. Here are the steps to take.

****Step 1:**** Hold the “Power” button until the Vivo V30 Pro device turns off.

**Tip:** If you hold down the power button for a few seconds, you will see the “Power Off” and “Restart” options on the screen. You can’t use it because the entire screen isn’t responding. Hence, you should press and hold the “Power” button for as long as necessary.

![restart android with power button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-1.JPG)

****Step 2:**** When the Vivo V30 Pro device turns off, wait a few seconds.

****Step 3:**** Press and hold the “Power” button to restart the Vivo V30 Pro device.

Check to see if the Android auto touch screen is not working problem has been resolved. Otherwise, proceed with the following methods.

### Turn On Safe Mode

You should switch to Safe mode whenever an application or piece of software causes a problem on your device. Only the most fundamental system components are loaded and used when operating in Safe mode.

If your touch screen is functional in safe mode, the issue is most likely internal. You can quickly fix the Android touchscreen issue by following the prompts given below to activate the safe mode:

****Step 1:**** To force a restart, press and hold the Vivo V30 Pro device’s “Power” button for an extended period.

****Step 2:**** Maintain pressure on the “Power” button. Take your finger off it once you see the manufacturer’s logo.

****Step 3:**** When you let go of the “Power” button, press and hold the “Volume Down” button. After that, a “Safe Mode” label will appear in your screen’s lower-left corner.

### Turn Off Developer Options

Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.

If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:

****Step 1:**** Launch the ****Settings**** app on your device.

****Step 2:**** Select the ****System**** menu item, which usually locates at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3:** Tap the Advanced options menu, then select Developer Options.

****Step 4:**** You will then find the switch to turn it on or off. Disable itby toggling the button off.

****Step 5:**** Restart your device to check if the part of the touch screen not working issue has been resolved.

### Reset Device to Factory Settings

Resetting your device to its factory settings will return it to its state when you first unboxed it. All your phone’s data and installed apps will be erased, including any malware on your device that may be causing the issue to occur. Here’s how to restore your device to factory settings:

****Step 1:**** Since your touch screen is not working, you can factory reset it using Google’s Find My Device web service.

****Step 2:**** Go to **Find My Device** from any d****evice**** and sign in to the Google account associated with the damaged screen device.

****Step 3:**** After successfully logging in, you will see your device’s name. Select the ****Erase Device**** option.
