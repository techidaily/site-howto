## How to Fix the Soft Bricked Vivo Y27 4G?

Bricked phone is a serious problem, as your brick smartphone could be suffering from a soft brick or hard brick problem, and must be dealt with carefully. It is very common to see a brick smartphone these days. If you are wondering what exactly is a bricked phone, here is your answer.

A bricked phone, hard brick or soft brick, is a smartphone which refuses to start or boot all the way up the home/main screen of the Vivo Y27 4G device. This issue is observed within most Android phones because users have a tendency to tamper with the Vivo Y27 4G device settings, flashing new and customized ROMs and tweaking with the essential files. Playing around with the phone’s internal set-up leads to such errors, worst of them being a brick smartphone. Usually, a bricked phone does not switch on and stays frozen at the Vivo Y27 4G device logo, a blank screen or even worse, doesn't respond to any command, even the power on command.

## Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?
