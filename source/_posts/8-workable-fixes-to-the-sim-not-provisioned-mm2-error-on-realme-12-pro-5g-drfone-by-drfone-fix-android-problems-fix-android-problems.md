#### **2.2 Allow installation from unknown sources**

When we install Apps from other sources and not Google Play Store, there might be a glitch in using such Apps. To overcome this problem, turn on “Allow App installation from other sources”. Follow the steps given below for better understanding:

• Visit “Settings” and select “Applications”.

• Now tick mark on the option saying allow App installation from unknown sources.

#### **2.3 Enable USB debugging**

USB debugging is not considered necessary by many users but these methods give you an edge over others while using an Android device as it lets you access things on your phone, etc which you could not earlier.

To enable USB Debugging to fix “There is a problem parsing the package” error, follow these steps:

• Visit “Settings” and select “About Device”.

• Now click on “Build Number” not once but continuously for seven times.

• Once you see a pop-up saying “You are now a developer”, go back to “Settings”.

This should solve the problem. If not, move on to the other techniques.

#### **2.4 Check APK File**

An incomplete and irregular App installation may cause the .apk file to get corrupted. Make sure you download the file completely. If need be, delete the existing App or its .apk file and reinstall it from Google Play Store for it to be compatible with your device’s software and to use the App smoothly.

#### **2.5 Check App Manifest File**

Manifested App files are nothing but .apk files which are improvised by you. Such changes may cause the Parse Error to occur more frequently. Modifications in the App file can be made by changing its name, App settings, or more advanced customizations. Make sure you roll back all changes and restore the App file to its original state to prevent it from getting corrupted.

#### **2.6 Disable Antivirus and other cleaner Apps**

Antivirus software and other cleaning Apps are very helpful in blocking unwanted and harmful Apps from damaging your device. However, sometimes such Apps also prevent you from using other safe Apps.

We do not suggest that you delete the Antivirus App permanently. Temporary uninstallation will be useful here. To do so:

• Visit “Settings” and then select “Apps”.

• Select the antivirus App to click on “Uninstall” and then tap “OK”.

Now download and install the desired App again. Once this is done, do not forget to install the Antivirus App again.

#### **2.7 Clear Cache cookies of Play Store**

Clearing Play Store Cache cleans the Android Market platform by deleting all clogged up unwanted data. Follow the steps given below to delete Play Store cache:

• Tap on Google Play Store App.

• Now visit Play Store’s “Settings”.

![visit Play Store’s “Settings”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985109949391.jpg)

• Select “General Settings” to “Clear local search history”.

Follow the steps given below to factory reset your device:

• Visit “Settings”.

• Now select “Backup and Reset”.
