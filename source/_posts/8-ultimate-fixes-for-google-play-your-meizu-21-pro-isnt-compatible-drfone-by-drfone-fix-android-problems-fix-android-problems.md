Encountering the frustrating "**your device isn’t compatible with this version Google Play**" error can be disruptive. That's why it is essential to go through the underlying reasons causing this compatibility issue:

### 1\. Outdated Operating System Firmware

One of the primary culprits behind the compatibility error is [<u>outdated OS firmware</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html). App developers release updates to keep up with the latest features and security patches. That's why an obsolete OS version on your device may render it incompatible with the newer app versions available on the Google Play Store.

### 2\. Insufficient Hardware Requirements

Each application has specific hardware prerequisites that your device needs to fulfill. In case your smartphone does not meet the required specifications, you won't be able to utilize the app. Thus, Google Play Store may restrict access to certain applications, citing compatibility issues.

### 3\. Corrupted Cache Files

Cache files are designed to enhance the speed and efficiency of app loading. Yet, they can sometimes become corrupt. When this occurs, it disrupts the app's normal operation. Clearing these corrupted cache files is often a crucial step.

### 4\. Geographic Restrictions

In certain cases, app developers or Google Play itself may impose geographic restrictions. This could lead to compatibility issues if your device is located in an area where the app is restricted. Understanding the geographical availability of an app is vital in finding the root cause.

### 4\. Beta Versions and Unstable Releases

Engaging with beta versions or unstable releases of an app can result in compatibility issues. These versions are typically in the testing phase. That's why their compatibility with a wide range of devices may not be guaranteed. If you find yourself facing compatibility errors, it's worth checking if you are in a beta program.

### Method 5: Boot your device into safe mode

[Safe mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html) can temporarily disable third-party apps, allowing only core system apps. This detects if a third-party app causes the "Android process media keeps stopping" error. If the problem disappears in safe mode, a third-party app might be the cause. Uninstalling it can restore normal function. If the problem persists in safe mode, a deeper system issue might exist, needing further investigation or support.
