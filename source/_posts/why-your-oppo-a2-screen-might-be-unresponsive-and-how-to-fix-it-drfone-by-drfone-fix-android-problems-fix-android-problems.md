## Common Causes of Oppo A2 Screen Unresponsiveness

While Oppo A2 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Oppo A2 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Oppo A2, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Oppo A2 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Oppo A2 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Oppo A2 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Oppo A2 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Oppo A2 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Oppo A2 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Oppo A2 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Oppo A2 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent Oppo A2 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Oppo A2 device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid Oppo A2 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Oppo A2 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Oppo A2 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Oppo A2 App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Oppo A2 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data. With features such as System Repair and Data Backup & Restore, you can quickly diagnose and fix software issues that may cause unresponsiveness and safely back up important data to prevent loss in case of device damage or malfunction.

### Conclusion

Oppo A2 Screen unresponsiveness can be a frustrating issue to deal with, but there are solutions available. Force restarting the Oppo A2 device, checking for software updates, using Dr. Fone Repair, and contacting customer service are all effective ways to solve the problem. However, it's also important to understand the possible causes of the issue, such as soft-bricking or equipment wearing out, and take preventative measures, such as updating your phone on time and avoiding malware. These tips can help prevent Oppo A2 Screen unresponsiveness and keep your device running smoothly.

## Reasons for Oppo A2 Stuck on Startup Screen and Ways To Fix Them

There are many reasons why ****phones get stuck on the boot screen****. It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your ****phone stuck on the logo**** screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.

![samsung stuck on boot screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg)

This article will share the possible reasons why your ****phone is stuck on the boot screen****. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!

It is not uncommon for **phones** to be ****stuck on the startup screen****, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.

### Physical Damage to the Phone

If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your ****phone being stuck on the boot screen****.

If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your ****phone getting stuck on the logo.****

### Liquid Damage

It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.

Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your ****phone stuck on the boot screen****. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.

For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.

![iphone water indicator](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg)

### Software Issues

Software issues are probably the most common reason your ****phone is stuck on the logo**** screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.

The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the ****phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.**** Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.

## Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen

After understanding the common problems on why your phone is ****stuck on the startup screen**** page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.

### Hard reboot your phone

To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting ****stuck on the startup screen**** page.

Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Oppo A2. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.

![hard reboot of samsung](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg)

### Put your phone in recovery mode

If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.

Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Oppo A2 or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.

****Step 1****: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Oppo A2/Redmi phone

****Step 2****:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.

![xiaomi recovery mode operation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg)

****Step 3****: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.

### Factory Reset

If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your **phone being stuck on the startup screen** through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.

Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.

****Step 1****: Open the **Settings** application on your phone and **tap General Management**.

![general management on samsung](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg)
