With a full backup of your Infinix Smart 8 Plus, you can now embark on a mission to fix the error. There are several methods to clear this error. We have outlined three of the most effective solutions here.

Step 1: Go to "Settings" on your device.

Step 2: Access "Apps."

Step 3: Tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner and select "Reset App Preferences."

### Method 3: Clear the cache and data on your device

Step 1: Go to Settings> Applications> Manage Applications and find the Google Services framework.

Step 4: Press the back button to go back to the Google Services framework and then choose Force stop > clear cache > OK
