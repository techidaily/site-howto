This can happen to various models, such as the Vivo G2, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Vivo G2 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Vivo G2 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
