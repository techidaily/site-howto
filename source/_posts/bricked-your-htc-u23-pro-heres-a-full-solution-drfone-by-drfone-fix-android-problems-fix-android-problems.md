## What Causes A HTC U23 Pro Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a HTC U23 Pro phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of HTC U23 Pro screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot.

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of HTC U23 Pro screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

### 1. Restart The Device
