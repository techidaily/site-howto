A development in arranged availability goes hand-in-hand with the development of cell phones.

Itel P55 5G smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Itel P55 5G touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Itel P55 5G phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen. In this guide, you'll find the information you need to troubleshoot and fix the most common problems reported by Motorola customers.


## **What causes a Itel P55 5G Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Itel P55 5G phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Itel P55 5G device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Itel P55 5G smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Itel P55 5G 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.
