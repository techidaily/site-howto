Many users have reported that Chrome crashes or won’t open on their Vivo Y36. If you are also facing this issue, then you have come to the right place. In this article, we will discuss the reasons behind this problem and provide you with 7 solutions to fix Chrome crashes or won’t open on Vivo Y36.

Being one of the widely used browsers, Chrome is always our rescue whenever vital information is our need. Imagine, you launched Chrome for some urgent work and all of a sudden, got “Unfortunately Chrome has stopped” error. You re-opened it thinking about proper functioning of it now but to no avail. Does this situation sound familiar? Are you in a same problem as well? Fret not! We will discuss in this article why your Chrome is crashing on Android and the potential solutions to do away with the problem. Please read the article attentively and know what helps you best.

## Part 1: Too many tabs opened

One of the main reasons why Chrome keeps crashing could be the multiple opened tabs. If you keep open the tabs, it may slow down the performance of Chrome and the app will use RAM. As a result, it will obviously get stopped midway. Therefore, we suggest you to close the tabs which are opened. And once you do that, exit the app and then launch it again.

## Part 2: Too much memory used

When Chrome or any other app keeps running on the background, issues like “Unfortunately Chrome has stopped” are likely to occur. Moreover, the opened apps will eat the memory of your device. Hence, as the next solution, it is suggested that the Chrome should be closed by force quitting and then you need to try to launch it again to work. See if it works or still Chrome is not responding.

1\. Simply tap on the Home button twice to get on the recent apps screen. Please note that the button may vary to reach the screen. Please check once and move accordingly.

2\. Now simply swipe the app up/left/right (according to the Vivo Y36 device).

3\. The app will be force quit now. You can then start it again to check if thing get back to normal.

## Part 3: Chrome cache overflowing

While using any app for long, the temporary files for those gets collected in the form of cache. And when cache is not getting cleared, one may face the freezing, crashing or sluggish apps. And this could also be the cause why your Chrome keeps stopping. Hence, the following steps will show you how to clear cache and make Chrome work as before.

1\. Open “Settings” and go to “Apps & Notifications”.

2\. Look for “Chrome” and tap on it.

3\. Go to “Storage” and click on “Clear Cache”.

In such case, we would like to recommend you to make use of another browser and try to access the website from there. See if this works or not. If now, please follow the next solution.

Follow Regulations

Some industries and organizations have regulations that need them to protect sensitive data. Financial institutions must protect their customers’ financial information, for example. Disabling screenshots is one way to follow these regulations.

Prevent Fraud

Scammers and other criminals often use screenshots to commit fraud. For instance, people might send fake screenshots to trick others into sharing personal details or money. Disabling screenshots can help to prevent this type of fraud.

![whatsapp screenshot blocked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-03.jpg)

## Conclusion

You can fix the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error on Android in different ways. But it depends on the cause of the error. If an app is causing the error, you can try two things. First, remove the app’s screenshot restriction. Second, download a different screenshot app or a different device to take screenshots.

Although there are ways to bypass the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error message, it’s crucial to know why screenshots are not allowed. Many apps and websites do not permit it to protect sensitive information, prevent piracy, and follow regulations. They also do it to prevent fraud, protect user privacy, and safeguard intellectual property.

If you think the issue is with your Android system, or your device becomes bricked after trying other methods, experiencing app crashes, or otherwise malfunctioning, try using the Dr.Fone System Repair tool. It is worth trying and can fix most Android system issues in a few minutes.
