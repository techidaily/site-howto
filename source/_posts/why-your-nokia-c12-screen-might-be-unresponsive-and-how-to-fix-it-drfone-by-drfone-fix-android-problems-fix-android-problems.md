In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Nokia C12 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Nokia C12 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Nokia C12 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Nokia C12 App Store.
