A development in arranged availability goes hand-in-hand with the development of cell phones.

Itel A60s smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Itel A60s touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Itel A60s phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen. In this guide, you'll find the information you need to troubleshoot and fix the most common problems reported by Motorola customers.


## **What causes a Itel A60s Screen to be unresponsive?**

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Itel A60s smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery.
