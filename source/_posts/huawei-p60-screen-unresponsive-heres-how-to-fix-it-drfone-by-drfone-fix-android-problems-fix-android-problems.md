However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Huawei P60 touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Huawei P60 phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Huawei P60 touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Huawei P60 Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Huawei P60 phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Huawei P60 screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Huawei P60 Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Huawei P60 device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Huawei P60 screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Huawei P60 model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Huawei P60 Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Huawei P60 Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Huawei P60 screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Huawei P60 model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Huawei P60 black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Huawei P60's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Huawei P60 device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Huawei P60 device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Huawei P60logo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Huawei P60 device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Huawei P60 device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Huawei P60 device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Huawei P60 device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Huawei P60 device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Huawei P60 Y2 and Huawei P60 5A.

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Huawei P60 device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Huawei P60 device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built.
