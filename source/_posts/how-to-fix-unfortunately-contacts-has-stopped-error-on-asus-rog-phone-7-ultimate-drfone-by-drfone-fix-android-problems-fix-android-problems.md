3. Under the available settings, tick the box that allows your Bluetooth device to be discoverable
4. Turn your Bluetooth feature on and connect to the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device you’re trying to connect too

Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

1. Disconnect your Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate from the Bluetooth device and turn your Bluetooth off
2. Now take another Bluetooth device and connect this to the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device you’re trying to connect too. This could be another Android device, or even a computer or iOS device
3. If the new device doesn’t connect to your Bluetooth device, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Bluetooth device, not your Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate
4. If the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate to the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.
