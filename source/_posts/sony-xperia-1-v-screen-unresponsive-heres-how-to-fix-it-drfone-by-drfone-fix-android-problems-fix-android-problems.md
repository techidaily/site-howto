We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Sony Xperia 1 V touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Sony Xperia 1 V Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Sony Xperia 1 V phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Sony Xperia 1 V screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Sony Xperia 1 V Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Sony Xperia 1 V device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Sony Xperia 1 V screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Sony Xperia 1 V model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Sony Xperia 1 V Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Sony Xperia 1 V Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Sony Xperia 1 V screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Sony Xperia 1 V model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Sony Xperia 1 V black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Sony Xperia 1 V's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Sony Xperia 1 V device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Sony Xperia 1 V device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Sony Xperia 1 Vlogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Sony Xperia 1 V device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Sony Xperia 1 V device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Sony Xperia 1 V device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Sony Xperia 1 V device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Sony Xperia 1 V device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Sony Xperia 1 V Y2 and Sony Xperia 1 V 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the Sony Xperia 1 V device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.
