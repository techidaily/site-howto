Sometimes, you may have a problem with the Lava Blaze 2 device you’re trying to connect to via Bluetooth, especially if this is a device you’ve updated. To counter and repair this, you’re going to need to remove the paired devices saved with your device and then reconnect them.

Here’s how;

1. From the Main Menu of your Lava Blaze 2, head to Settings > Bluetooth > Connected Devices.

### 2.5 Use Bluetooth in safe mode

![android bluetooth problems - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-safemode.jpg)

![android bluetooth problems - exclude Bluetooth issues of others](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-newphone.jpeg)

Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your Lava Blaze 2, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

1. Disconnect your Lava Blaze 2 from the Bluetooth device and turn your Bluetooth off
2. Now take another Bluetooth device and connect this to the Lava Blaze 2 device you’re trying to connect too. This could be another Android device, or even a computer or iOS device

4. If the Lava Blaze 2 devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Lava Blaze 2

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the Lava Blaze 2 devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Lava Blaze 2 to the Lava Blaze 2 device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.

### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 1: Head to the “Settings” of your Lava Blaze 2 and then opt for “Wireless and Networks” followed by “WLAN/WiFi”.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 3: Depending on your Lava Blaze 2 model, look for “IP Settings” and tap on it. Now, switch the “DHCP” to “Static”.

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.
