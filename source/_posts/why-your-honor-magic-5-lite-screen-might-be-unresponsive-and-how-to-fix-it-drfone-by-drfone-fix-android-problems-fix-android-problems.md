While Honor Magic 5 Lite devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Honor Magic 5 Lite device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Honor Magic 5 Lite, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Honor Magic 5 Lite device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Honor Magic 5 Lite F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Honor Magic 5 Lite device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Honor Magic 5 Lite Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Honor Magic 5 Lite device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Honor Magic 5 Lite device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

Another way to avoid Honor Magic 5 Lite Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Honor Magic 5 Lite device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Honor Magic 5 Lite device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Honor Magic 5 Lite App Store.

## Part 2. 10 common ways to fix Android won't charge

### 1\. Check/replace charging cable

Charging cables fray or become defunct after prolonged usage. Therefore, it is advised to always use the Honor Magic 5 Lite device’s original charging cable or purchase a good quality charging cord, which doesn't damage your device or your adapter.

It is also very commonly observed that the charging end of the cable which gets connected to the charging port of the Honor Magic 5 Lite device gets damaged and prevents the current from flowing to the phone/tablet.

![charging cable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459762305.jpg)

### 2\. Check/clean charging port

The charging port in your device is a small opening where the charging end of the cabbie is inserted for the current to flow to the phone/tablet. Very often, we notice that the charging port gets blocked with tiny particles of dirt. The charging port might also get clogged if dirt and dust get accumulated in it, preventing the sensors from receiving and forwarding the current to the Honor Magic 5 Lite device.

### 3\. Check/replace charging adapter

This method is fairly simple, and all you need to do is check whether or not the charging adapter is working properly as sometimes, the adapter itself is to be blamed for the charge. To make sure that you are not using a defective adapter, connect your charging cable/USB to another adapter. If your device charges normally, it means there is a problem is with your adapter, and you must replace it at the earliest to solve My Honor Magic 5 Lite won't charge the issue.
