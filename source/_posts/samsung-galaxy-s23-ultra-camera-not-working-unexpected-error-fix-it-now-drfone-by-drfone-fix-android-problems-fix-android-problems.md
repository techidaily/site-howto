So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today.

Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.

![camera not working error in android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg)

## Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?

There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.

**Low Memory**

Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.

**Low Storage**

The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.

**General Bugs And Glitches**

OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.

**Hardware Issues**

In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.

## Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?

So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra right where you are, without needing to take the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device to the manufacturer’s service center.

### II.I: Restart The Handset

One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.

![restarting android handset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg)

Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.

### II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App

If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.

Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.

![closing apps in app switcher](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg)

Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.

### II.III: Check App Permissions

These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera > Permissions.

![camera permissions check android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Camera.

![set camera permissions android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg)

Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.

### II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache

Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera and tap Storage Usage.

![clear camera app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

![clear camera app cache android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg)

### II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache

The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Photos > Storage Usage.

![clear photo gallery app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

### II.VI: Check For App Updates

This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.

Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.

![google play store app updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.

![check for app updates play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg)

Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.

### II.VII: Cool The Phone Down

We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.

If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.

### II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System

You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.

### II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)

Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre. And, we have just the app to help you fix your camera not working on Android problem quickly.

## Fix Can't Take Screenshot Due to Security Policy on Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra

“**Can’t take screenshots due to security policy**” is a screenshot restriction on your Android smartphone. You’ve probably seen this error message before, especially when taking screenshots of banking or video streaming apps. But why do apps and websites block screenshots? It’s actually for your good.

Screenshots can be misused to steal money or pirate copyrighted content. By prohibiting screenshots, apps and websites can help to protect your data and privacy. If you want to learn more, keep reading. This article will explain why apps and websites prevent screenshot capture and why it’s important for security. We’ll also give you tips on how to take photos of apps and websites that don’t let you take screenshots.

## Part 1. Can’t Take Screenshots Due to Security Policy on Android? Here’s Why

Why can’t you take a screenshot of something on your phone and get the error message that says, “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**”? Apps and websites turn off or remove the screenshot feature for a variety of reasons, including:

Device Restrictions

Lots of workplaces and schools have rules against taking screenshots on devices used for work or school. Organizations do this to protect sensitive information and prevent data breaches.

Protect Sensitive Information

Say you’re trying to take a screenshot on your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device, and you get the notification “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy.” Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra** smartphones are not necessarily the problem.

Some apps and websites, such as banking apps, store private data like financial and credit card details. Blocking capturing screenshots is a way to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information.

![cryptocurrency app screenshot error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-02.jpg)

Follow Regulations

Some industries and organizations have regulations that need them to protect sensitive data. Financial institutions must protect their customers’ financial information, for example. Disabling screenshots is one way to follow these regulations.

DRM-Protected Content

**Android can’t take screenshots due to security policy**, especially to prevent piracy. Piracy is the distribution of copyrighted material without permission. It can harm businesses that depend on copyright protection.

To prevent this, you can use DRM (digital rights management) to protect copyrighted content. DRM-protected content cannot be screenshotted or copied.

Prevent Fraud

Scammers and other criminals often use screenshots to commit fraud. For instance, people might send fake screenshots to trick others into sharing personal details or money. Disabling screenshots can help to prevent this type of fraud.

Protect Intellectual Property

Many businesses and organizations have valuable information they want to keep safe, such as trade secrets. Disabling screenshots can be helpful to prevent the theft of this intellectual property.

Protect User Privacy

Some apps and websites allow users to share private information. Some apps, like messaging apps, let users share private info. But there are limits.

![whatsapp screenshot blocked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-03.jpg)

## Part 2. 8 Ways To Take Screenshots When You Can’t Due to Security Policy

If you’re trying to take a screenshot of an app or website with a security policy in place, there’s usually no way to circumvent it. However, there are a few things you can do to take pictures of these apps and website content.

Enable Screen Capture on Android

Sudden “**can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” notifications, failing to take a screenshot, and a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra user?

If you are using this Android device, you can enable the screen capture feature in the Settings app.

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** > **Apps**, then tap the **More options** icon in the upper right corner.

![android app settings interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-04.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Choose **Special access** > **All files access**.

![enable samsung capture](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-06.jpg)

Once you have enabled screen capture, you can check if you can take screenshots of any app or website.

Enable Screenshots in Incognito Mode

Apps and websites may prohibit screenshots in incognito mode to protect your privacy. However, you can enable the Incognito Screenshot experimental flag in Chrome to bypass this restriction.

- **Step 1:** Open Chrome on your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and type “chrome://flags” in the address bar.

![chrome experimental flags](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-07.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Search for Incognito Screenshot and choose **Enabled** from the drop-down menu.

![incognito screenshot enabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-08.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Tap **Relaunch** on the lower right corner of the screen.

Once Chrome has relaunched, you should be able to take screenshots in incognito mode by pressing the power and volume-down buttons at the same time.

Use Google Assistant

![google assistant command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-09.jpg)

Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots

You can download several applications on Google Play Store if you still can’t take a screenshot due to security policy. Some popular third-party screenshot apps include:

- Screenshot Easy
- Screenshot Tile
- Screen Master: Screenshot Markup

Third-party screenshot apps often use different methods to capture the screen. These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.

Capture Your Phone Display With Another Device

If you own another smartphone, you can use it to take a photo of the screen of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device you’re trying to take a screenshot of. This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.

Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions

Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.

Screen Mirroring

Smart View allows you to display your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device’s screen on your smart TV, where you can then take a screenshot of the TV to capture the app or website you need.

- **Step 1:** Swipe down the top of the screen to access the **Quick Settings** panel.
- **Step 2:** Tap the **Smart View** icon.
- **Step 3:** Select your TV from the list of available devices and tap **Start Now**.

![cast samsung phone using smart view](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-10.jpg)

Alternatively, if you don’t have a smart TV, you can still mirror your phone screen display to your desktop or tablet using the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Flow app and take a screenshot of your phone’s screen instead.

Use Disable Flag Secure Magisk Module

Still experiencing the error message, “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy?” Bypass Android** phone error like this using a module.

The module patches the Android framework to remove the FLAG\_SECURE flag from apps. It is a relatively simple process but requires root access and Magisk. This module will turn off the security flag to take screenshots in Incognito mode and other apps.
