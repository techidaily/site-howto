Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty.

Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.

Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update.
