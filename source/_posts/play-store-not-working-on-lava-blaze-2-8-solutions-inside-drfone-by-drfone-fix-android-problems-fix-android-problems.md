You can simply rule out this possibility by ejecting the SIM card from its original SIM slot and then replacing it into the other SIM card slot. If this solution did work out for you then it is obvious that the problem was with the SIM card slot that got corrupted. And hence, it was triggering SIM not responding issue.
