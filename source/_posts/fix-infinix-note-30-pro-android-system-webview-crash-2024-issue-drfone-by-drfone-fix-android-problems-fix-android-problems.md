Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing **Android WebView crash**. These include:

- **App Freezing**

- **Unexpected App Closures**

Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. **Infinix Note 30 Pro Android System WebView crashing apps** can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.
