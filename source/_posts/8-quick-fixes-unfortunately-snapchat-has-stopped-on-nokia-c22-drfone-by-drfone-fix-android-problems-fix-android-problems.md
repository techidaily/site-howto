**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Nokia C22, followed by the Wi-Fi option.

- **Flashing Stock/Custom ROM:**It is possible that you installed an incompatible ROM in the Android phone, that the phone shuts off during the process, or that you have performed other errors that cause your phone to restart indefinitely or to become stuck at the starting screen.
- **Rooting an Android device:**You are unable to effectively root the Nokia C22 device.
- **Android firmware is being updated:**If the phone is interrupted when updating the Android firmware, it will be bricked.
