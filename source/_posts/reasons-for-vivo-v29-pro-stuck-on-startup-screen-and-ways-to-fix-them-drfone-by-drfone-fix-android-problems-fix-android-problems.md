Having your ****phone stuck on the logo**** screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.

![samsung stuck on boot screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg)

This article will share the possible reasons why your ****phone is stuck on the boot screen****. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!

It is not uncommon for **phones** to be ****stuck on the startup screen****, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.

### Physical Damage to the Phone

If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your ****phone being stuck on the boot screen****.

If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your ****phone getting stuck on the logo.****

### Liquid Damage

It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.

Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your ****phone stuck on the boot screen****. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.

For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.

![iphone water indicator](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg)

### Software Issues

Software issues are probably the most common reason your ****phone is stuck on the logo**** screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.

The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the ****phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.**** Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.

## Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen

After understanding the common problems on why your phone is ****stuck on the startup screen**** page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.

### Hard reboot your phone

To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting ****stuck on the startup screen**** page.

Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Vivo V29 Pro. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.

![hard reboot of samsung](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg)

### Put your phone in recovery mode

If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.

Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Vivo V29 Pro or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.

****Step 1****: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Vivo V29 Pro/Redmi phone

****Step 2****:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.

![xiaomi recovery mode operation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg)

****Step 3****: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.

### Factory Reset

If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your **phone being stuck on the startup screen** through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.

Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.

****Step 1****: Open the **Settings** application on your phone and **tap General Management**.

![general management on samsung](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg)
