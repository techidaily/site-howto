If your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023)’s screen is not responding to touches for technical reasons, follow the methods below to resolve the issue.

### Restart Your Device

When your touch screen stops working, the first thing you should do is restart your device. The operation is known as soft resetting. You cannot turn your device off from the option on the screen because the touch screen is not responding. Here are the steps to take.

****Step 1:**** Hold the “Power” button until the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device turns off.

**Tip:** If you hold down the power button for a few seconds, you will see the “Power Off” and “Restart” options on the screen. You can’t use it because the entire screen isn’t responding. Hence, you should press and hold the “Power” button for as long as necessary.

![restart android with power button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-1.JPG)

****Step 3:**** Press and hold the “Power” button to restart the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device.

Check to see if the Android auto touch screen is not working problem has been resolved. Otherwise, proceed with the following methods.

### Turn On Safe Mode

You should switch to Safe mode whenever an application or piece of software causes a problem on your device. Only the most fundamental system components are loaded and used when operating in Safe mode.

If your touch screen is functional in safe mode, the issue is most likely internal. You can quickly fix the Android touchscreen issue by following the prompts given below to activate the safe mode:

****Step 1:**** To force a restart, press and hold the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device’s “Power” button for an extended period.

### Turn Off Developer Options

Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.

If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:

****Step 1:**** Launch the ****Settings**** app on your device.

****Step 2:**** Select the ****System**** menu item, which usually locates at the bottom of the screen.

### Reset Device to Factory Settings

Resetting your device to its factory settings will return it to its state when you first unboxed it. All your phone’s data and installed apps will be erased, including any malware on your device that may be causing the issue to occur. Here’s how to restore your device to factory settings:

## Fix App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Problem on Vivo Y55s 5G (2023)

Mobile applications are important for smooth operations when it comes to smartphones. They offer convenience, entertainment, and functionality at your fingertips. However, encountering the "**App Not Available in Your Country Play Store**" issue can be frustrating. It can quickly dampen the excitement of discovering a new app.

This is mainly due to geographical restrictions that are often imposed by developers. It poses a hurdle for users eager to access a particular application. However, there is no need to worry, as this article will help you in resolving this issue. It will delve into effective strategies and solutions to ensure the unavailability of an app is no longer an obstacle.

## Part 1: Reasons Behind the App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Issue

Encountering the "**Google Play App Not Available in Your Country**" issue can feel like hitting a roadblock. This restriction hampers your ability to explore and use valuable apps. It can also disrupt the smooth functioning of your daily digital activities. Before going for solutions, it is crucial to understand the reasons causing this restriction in installing apps on smartphones:

### 1\. Regional Restrictions

One of the primary culprits behind this issue is the regional restrictions imposed by developers. Developers often roll out their apps gradually across different regions. It is done to adhere to legal and licensing requirements. This staggered release strategy ensures compliance with local laws. Moreover, it guarantees a smooth user experience tailored to specific geographical locations.

### 2\. Licensing and Legal Constraints

Licensing agreements and legal constraints play an important role when it comes to the accessibility of apps. Developers may encounter licensing issues. This can prevent them from offering their apps in certain regions. It is due to copyright, trademark, or other legal considerations. Navigating the complex web of international laws and agreements is a big hassle. It becomes a determining factor in the availability of apps on the Play Store.

### 3\. Localization Challenges

Apps are often designed with specific markets in mind. These incorporate language, cultural, and regulatory considerations to enhance user experience. The absence of proper localization can render an app incompatible with specific regions. It includes factors such as adapting the app for different languages, currencies, and cultural nuances. This can result in the app being excluded from the **Play Store app not available in your country.**

### 4\. Device and OS Compatibility

The compatibility between the app, the user's device, and its OS is another factor that contributes to this issue. Developers might restrict their app availability to certain devices or OS versions. It can restrict access for users whose devices or OS do not meet the app's requirements. This technical limitation adds another layer to the complexity of app availability.

### 5\. Political and Economic Factors

In some instances, political tensions or economic considerations can also be a factor. It may influence the accessibility of apps in certain countries. Geo-political factors, trade sanctions, or economic conditions can impact the distribution of apps. This leads developers to exclude specific regions from their app's availability.

## Part 2: 4 Tested Methods To Fix Google Play App Not Available in Your Country

The right app can make a major difference in work efficiency or personal enjoyment. That's why facing the "**Play Store app not available in your country**" issue can be frustrating. The positive aspect is that many solutions exist for addressing this issue. Presented below are the top 4 approaches to resolving this matter:

### Method 1: Change Your Google Play Store Country

One of the most direct ways to address this issue is by manually adjusting your Google Play Store country settings. Google allows users to change their country or region. Remember that you can only do it once a year. To utilize this approach, it's essential to reside in the specified country. The other option is to provide a payment method originating from that particular region. Below is a detailed walkthrough for this procedure:

- **Step 1.** Launch the Google Play Store on your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) and tap the “Profile” icon from the top right corner. Here, choose "Settings" and follow on to tap "General."

![general settings play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-1.jpg)

![update residence country](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-2.jpg)

### Method 2: Use a Reliable VPN

Confronting the message "**This app is not accessible in your country" on the Play Store**? Employing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be an effective strategy. It allows you to virtually transcend geographical restrictions. A VPN masks your actual location by routing your internet connection through servers in different regions.

You can utilize a reliable VPN to access the Play Store as though you were in a region where the desired app is accessible. Follow this step-by-step guide to address this concern:

- **Step 1.** Access the Google Play Store and download a reliable VPN for the procedure. Open the VPN you download and connect to the country of your choice. Once you have connected your device’s IP to another country using the VPN, continue to your home screen.

![get vpn from play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-3.jpg)

### Method 3: Download an APK File

This method involves installing the application manually, bypassing the Google Play Store. Follow these sequential instructions to download and install an APK file:

- **Step 1.** Before starting, ensure that you have enabled the installation from unknown sources. Afterward, find a reliable website and search for your targeted apps.
