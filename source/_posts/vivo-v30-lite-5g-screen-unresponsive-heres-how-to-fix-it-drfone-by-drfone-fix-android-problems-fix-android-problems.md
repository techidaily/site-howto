This article aims to provide solutions for Vivo V30 Lite 5G phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Vivo V30 Lite 5G touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Vivo V30 Lite 5G Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Vivo V30 Lite 5G phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Vivo V30 Lite 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Vivo V30 Lite 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Vivo V30 Lite 5G screens to become unresponsive.

These issues can also occur in any Vivo V30 Lite 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Vivo V30 Lite 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Vivo V30 Lite 5G Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Vivo V30 Lite 5G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

### 1. Restart The Device

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Vivo V30 Lite 5G black screen problem.
