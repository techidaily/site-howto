![fix wifi keep disconnecting android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/why-does-my-phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi.jpg)

Since everything revolves around the internet, it's annoying if your WI-FI disconnects. You might question yourself **why does my Wi-Fi keep disconnecting from the phone**? To know the answer, read the article below.

## Part 1: Why Does Your Phone Keep Disconnecting from WiFi?

Is your phone frequently getting disconnected from Wi-Fi? Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Tecno Spark 10 Pro devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:

- **Router Problems**

If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.

- **Out of Wi-Fi Range**

**Why does My Tecno Spark 10 Pro keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi**? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.

- **Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked**

The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.

- **Devices Connected with Router**

Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.

- **Unstable Internet**

If your Tecno Spark 10 Pro gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.

Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.

## Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone

As we have mentioned earlier if your Wi-Fi is stable, but it keeps disconnecting from [Tecno Spark 10 Pro S22](https://drfone.wondershare.com/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s22.html) or other Android phones, the coming section of this article is for you.

<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_eAyzfmK8Vs"></iframe>

### Fix 1: Restart Your Phone

If the Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting from your Tecno Spark 10 Pro, but the internet is stable, then you should try to fix the issue by restarting your phone. Sometimes, it's the phone that’s causing a problem, so to resolve it, you can follow the steps given below:

**Step 1**: Firstly, unlock your phone. Now, press the Power button and hold it for a few seconds.

**Step 2**: Now, select the 'Reboot' option to resolve the issue from the options on the screen.

![select reboot option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-1.jpg)

### Fix 2: Check Router Settings

If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings. This is because your phone might be blocked from connecting to the network, and if this is the scenario, your phone will never maintain the connection. You should check the Router’s admin panel or app to remove your phone from the blocklist.

![check router settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-2.jpg)

### Fix 3: Reconnect to Network

To fix the annoying problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting, you should try forgetting the network and then reconnecting to it. This could be done easily by following the steps below:

**Step 1**: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.

![tap on your wifi option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg)

**Step 2**: A list of all the Wi-Fi networks will appear on the screen. Select the network that is causing trouble from that list and hit the 'Forget Network' option.

![click on forgot network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-4.jpg)

**Step 3**: After that, you should reconnect to this Wi-Fi network by selecting it from the Wi-Fi list and entering its password.

![enter wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-5.jpg)

### Fix 4: Restart Your Router

As we discussed, to restart your phone, you can also restart the router to get rid of the problem. For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start. If the Tecno Spark 10 Pro device has no button, disconnect the power supply and plug it back in to connect again. Most internet issues are resolved by restarting the router.

![restart wifi router](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-6.jpg)

### Fix 5: Forget Old Networks

The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.

**Step 1**: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.

![open wifi settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-7.jpg)

![forgot unnecessary wifi connections](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-8.jpg)

### Fix 6. Check Recently Installed Applications

Sometimes, different installed applications can also cause trouble. If your Wi-Fi was fine, but suddenly it started disconnecting, then don’t forget to check the recently installed apps. This is because with not knowing the damage it can cause, you might have installed some VPNs, connections boosters, or firewalls. You can try and disable them but if that doesn’t resolve the problem, then uninstall the app.

**Step 1**: For uninstalling the problematic application, you have to select it and hold it. You will see a pop-up menu of multiple options; choose the option of ‘Uninstall' to remove the app from the phone.

![tap on uninstall button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-9.jpg)

### Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone

It’s annoying that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting while you are working or studying. Android users can easily get over this problem by resetting the network settings. The steps for this fix are as follows:

**Step 1**: For resetting the network, start by opening the ‘Settings’ menu on your phone. Then, scroll down, look for the 'Connection & Sharing' option, and select it.

![access connect and sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-10.jpg)
