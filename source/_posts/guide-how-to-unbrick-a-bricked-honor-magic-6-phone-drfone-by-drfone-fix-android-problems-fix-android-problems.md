## Conclusion

You can fix the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error on Android in different ways. But it depends on the cause of the error. If an app is causing the error, you can try two things. First, remove the app’s screenshot restriction. Second, download a different screenshot app or a different device to take screenshots.

Although there are ways to bypass the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error message, it’s crucial to know why screenshots are not allowed. Many apps and websites do not permit it to protect sensitive information, prevent piracy, and follow regulations. They also do it to prevent fraud, protect user privacy, and safeguard intellectual property.

If you think the issue is with your Android system, or your device becomes bricked after trying other methods, experiencing app crashes, or otherwise malfunctioning, try using the Dr.Fone System Repair tool. It is worth trying and can fix most Android system issues in a few minutes.
