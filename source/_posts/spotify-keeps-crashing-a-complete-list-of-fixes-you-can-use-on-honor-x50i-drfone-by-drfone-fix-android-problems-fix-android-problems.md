## Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System

Losing data on your Honor X50i is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don't really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here's how to easily do that.

Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Honor X50i, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the "Backup & Restore" option on the screen.

Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.

Step 3: After the process is complete, choose "Reboot" to restart the Honor X50i device.

Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery > backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.

To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.

Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup & Restore from the menu list.

Step 2: Press "Restore" to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created

Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.

Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive.
