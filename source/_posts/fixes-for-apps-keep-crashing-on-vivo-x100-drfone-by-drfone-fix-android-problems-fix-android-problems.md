## Fixes for Apps Keep Crashing on Vivo X100

The rapid evolution of technology has transformed our smartphones into powerful devices. Presently, with just a few taps, they possess the ability to accomplish a diverse array of tasks. It has been possible due to the extensive availability of mobile applications. However, it can be incredibly frustrating when your favorite apps keep crashing repeatedly.

You're not alone if you're an Android user who encounters app crashes. This article will explore ten practical ways to fix apps that keep crashing on Android devices. We will also discuss the causes behind app crashes and how to prevent them.

## Part 1: What Are the Causes Behind Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

There are many reasons for ****the app crashing**** on Android devices. These reasons range from insufficient storage space to bugs and glitches in the apps. Finding out the root cause of an app crashing is important so that you can find the appropriate solution. Discussed below are some of the reasons why your Android apps keep crashing:

### Insufficient Memory

When a device is low on memory, it may struggle to run multiple apps simultaneously. Each app requires memory to store its data and execute its processes. If the available memory is limited, it can cause apps to crash. That happens because they don't have enough resources to operate properly.

### Software Compatibility

Android devices come in various models and run different operating system versions. That's why it is essential to use apps compatible with your device. Since there are a lot of Android variants, it is hard to optimize apps for all devices. An app not optimized for an Android version or device leads to crashes or malfunctions.

### Outdated Apps

Apps are regularly updated to introduce new features, fix bugs, and enhance performance. Using an outdated version of an app may cause instability or compatibility problems. Since the app is not optimized for the current version of Android, it can keep crashing.

### Network Problems

Some apps rely heavily on network connectivity to function properly. They need a stable and strong internet connection to perform all the functions. These apps can crash if there are network connectivity issues, such as a weak Wi-Fi or network outage. Unstable connections can disrupt data transmission, making the app's function challenging.

### App Bugs

Despite rigorous testing, apps can still have bugs or coding errors that lead to crashes. Bugs in apps can occur due to various reasons. It mostly relates to incorrect implementation of features or unexpected user interactions. App developers work to identify and fix these bugs, often releasing updates.

## Part 2: How to Fix the Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

One of the most common solutions in technology is simply to turn it on and off again, which is the case to happen here. By restarting your device, you can clear out any problems you may be suffering from to help it get up and running again. Here’s how;

1. Turn your Vivo X100 off by holding down the Power button

### 2.4 Remove paired devices

![android bluetooth problems - remove paired devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-paried.jpg)

Sometimes, you may have a problem with the Vivo X100 device you’re trying to connect to via Bluetooth, especially if this is a device you’ve updated. To counter and repair this, you’re going to need to remove the paired devices saved with your device and then reconnect them.

Here’s how;

1. From the Main Menu of your Vivo X100, head to Settings > Bluetooth > Connected Devices.
2. Turn Bluetooth on, and you’ll see all the connections your Vivo X100 is paired with
3. Go through these settings and remove/delete/forget every connection on your device
4. Now when you go to connect to a device using Bluetooth, repair the Vivo X100 device, enter the passcode, and use a fresh paired connection.

### 2.5 Use Bluetooth in safe mode

![android bluetooth problems - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-safemode.jpg)

If you’re having problems with your connection and paired devices, sometimes you may have conflicting software faults in your device that are causing the problems. If this is the case, you’ll need to boot your Vivo X100 in Safe Mode.

This is an operating state in which your phone will run the bare minimum services it needs to perform. If your Bluetooth works in Safe Mode, you know you have an app or a service that’s causing the problem.

Here’s how to find out;

1. Hold the power button down, so the Android power menu turns on
2. Long-press the power button again and the restart in Safe Mode option will come up
3. The phone will automatically boot into Safe Mode

Here’s how to turn on your Bluetooth discoverable feature;

1. From the home screen of your Android, navigate to the Menu> Settings > Bluetooth
2. Toggle the Bluetooth switch, so it’s on
3. Under the available settings, tick the box that allows your Bluetooth device to be discoverable
4. Turn your Bluetooth feature on and connect to the Vivo X100 device you’re trying to connect too

### 2.7 Exclude Bluetooth issues of the other device

![android bluetooth problems - exclude Bluetooth issues of others](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-newphone.jpeg)

Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your Vivo X100, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

1. Disconnect your Vivo X100 from the Bluetooth device and turn your Bluetooth off
2. Now take another Bluetooth device and connect this to the Vivo X100 device you’re trying to connect too. This could be another Android device, or even a computer or iOS device
3. If the new device doesn’t connect to your Bluetooth device, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Bluetooth device, not your Vivo X100
4. If the Vivo X100 devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Vivo X100

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the Vivo X100 devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Vivo X100 to the Vivo X100 device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.

Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots

You can download several applications on Google Play Store if you still can’t take a screenshot due to security policy. Some popular third-party screenshot apps include:

- Screenshot Easy
- Screenshot Tile
- Screen Master: Screenshot Markup

Third-party screenshot apps often use different methods to capture the screen. These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.

Capture Your Phone Display With Another Device

If you own another smartphone, you can use it to take a photo of the screen of the Vivo X100 device you’re trying to take a screenshot of. This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.

Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions

Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.

Screen Mirroring

Smart View allows you to display your Vivo X100 device’s screen on your smart TV, where you can then take a screenshot of the TV to capture the app or website you need.

- **Step 1:** Swipe down the top of the screen to access the **Quick Settings** panel.
- **Step 2:** Tap the **Smart View** icon.
- **Step 3:** Select your TV from the list of available devices and tap **Start Now**.

Alternatively, if you don’t have a smart TV, you can still mirror your phone screen display to your desktop or tablet using the Vivo X100 Flow app and take a screenshot of your phone’s screen instead.
