However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Lava Blaze 2 5G touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Lava Blaze 2 5G phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Lava Blaze 2 5G touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Lava Blaze 2 5G Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Lava Blaze 2 5G phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Lava Blaze 2 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Lava Blaze 2 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Lava Blaze 2 5G device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Lava Blaze 2 5G screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Lava Blaze 2 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Lava Blaze 2 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Lava Blaze 2 5G Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Lava Blaze 2 5G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Lava Blaze 2 5G model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Lava Blaze 2 5G black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Lava Blaze 2 5G's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Lava Blaze 2 5G device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Lava Blaze 2 5G device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Lava Blaze 2 5Glogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Lava Blaze 2 5G device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Lava Blaze 2 5G device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Lava Blaze 2 5G device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Lava Blaze 2 5G device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Lava Blaze 2 5G device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Lava Blaze 2 5G Y2 and Lava Blaze 2 5G 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built.
