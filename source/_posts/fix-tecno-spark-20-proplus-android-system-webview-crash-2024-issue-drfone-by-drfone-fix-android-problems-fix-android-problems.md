## Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error

You may ask: Why can't I download apps on my Tecno Spark 20 Pro+? Understanding the underlying causes of the "Android App Not Installed" error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:

1\. Insufficient storage

Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.

2\. Corrupted/Contaminated App file

When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.

3\. SD Card not mounted in the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device

At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.

4\. Storage location

You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn't installed because of an unknown Error Code.

5\. Corrupt storage

Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn't installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.

6\. Application Permission

Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.

7\. Incorrect file

If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.

The Unknown Error Code during Application installation can occur due to any one or more of the reasons stated above. So read them carefully and understand them well to avoid such glitches in the future.
