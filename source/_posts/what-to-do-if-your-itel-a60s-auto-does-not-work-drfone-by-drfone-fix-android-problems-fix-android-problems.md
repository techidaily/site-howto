## Scenario 7. Phone Hangs on Installed App

There are scenarios where a phone, like the Itel A60s 3, hangs or gets stuck on a specific installed app. It happens during the startup process, and it can prevent the Itel A60s device from turning on properly. This issue often arises due to a malfunctioning or poorly coded app. This app disrupts the Itel A60s device's startup routine, causing **Itel A60s 4 won’t turn on**.

### Reason 2. Problematic App

**Solution:** While in Safe Mode, observe if the Itel A60s device boots up properly. If it successfully boots, it suggests that a third-party application is causing the problem. To pinpoint the problematic app, uninstall recently added apps individually and restart the Itel A60s device after each removal. This process helps pinpoint the problematic app causing the hang during startup.
