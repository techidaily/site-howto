## Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot

Sometimes, people complain that Tecno Spark 10 Pro is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.

Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.

![android not receiving texts - free up space](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg)

## Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App

## Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone

If the Tecno Spark 10 Pro phone is not receiving texts from iPhone, then this might be a different issue.
