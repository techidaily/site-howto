Vivo V30 Pro cell phones are presently utilized for perusing the Internet and exploring through maps, photography, videography, and numerous other used cases. A development in arranged availability goes hand-in-hand with the development of cell phones.

Vivo V30 Pro smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Vivo V30 Pro touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Vivo V30 Pro phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen. In this guide, you'll find the information you need to troubleshoot and fix the most common problems reported by Motorola customers.


## **What causes a Vivo V30 Pro Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Vivo V30 Pro phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Vivo V30 Pro device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Vivo V30 Pro smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Vivo V30 Pro 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

### **There might be issues with the Vivo V30 Pro device itself**

Screens on Vivo V30 Pro devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every Vivo V30 Pro device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.

### **There might be errors in the updated software**

The Android operating system is adjustable. Some of our technological advancements may backfire on us. The phone won't power on or become stuck in a boot loop where the logo will only show intermittently. For example, some Vivo V30 Pro 4 and 5 users have reported their screens are unresponsive after a software update, rendering the Vivo V30 Pro device unusable.

## **The common solutions to solve a Vivo V30 Pro Screen unresponsive**
