3. Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.

### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending.

### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your Lava Yuva 2 Pro in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.

### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 1: Head to the “Settings” of your Lava Yuva 2 Pro and then opt for “Wireless and Networks” followed by “WLAN/WiFi”.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 3: Depending on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro model, look for “IP Settings” and tap on it. Now, switch the “DHCP” to “Static”.

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.
