## What causes the Honor 90 Lite Screen unresponsive?

The Honor 90 Lite screen may become unresponsive due to various reasons. Here are some common situations and their possible causes:

- **During Use/Gaming:** The screen may become unresponsive due to overheating when using or gaming on a Honor 90 Lite phone.

- **No Response When Touching the Screen:**Sometimes, the Honor 90 Lite screen may not respond when touched due to a faulty touch screen or display. This can happen due to physical damage or a manufacturing defect. Some Honor 90 Lite Nord 2 users have reported this issue.
