- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.

![search if spotify is down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-20.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Go to one or two and see what they say. If Spotify is down, you’ll need to wait for them to fix the problem.

### 11. Clear the Cache

![settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-22.jpg)

First and foremost, the thing that can let you get rid of this trouble is Safe Mode. It is a feature that will end any excessive background functioning of the Oppo A79 5G device. For instance, your device will be able to run sans any third-party apps when in Safe mode. Since the important functions and the naïve apps will be running on the Oppo A79 5G device, you will get to know if it’s really a software glitch or not by running the Phone app in Safe mode. And this is the first solution we would recommend you make use of when the Phone app has stopped. Here is how to enable Safe Mode.

And if attempting the previous methods isn’t of any use, try updating Google Play services when you find the Phone app stopped. For doing this, you need to make sure that automatic updates are turned on in Google settings. If not, enable it and get the apps including Google Play services updated for smoother functions.
