### 2.2 Ensure the SIM card is not dirty or wet

At times, the issue can be as simple as cleaning your SIM card and SIM slot properly. Ensuring that SIM is not wet either and then putting it back into its place. If this works, then the SIM not working in Android was due to the dirt or moisture that was preventing proper contact between SIM card pins and smartphone circuit.

### 2.3 Insert the SIM card correctly

If your SIM card was working properly until yet, there is a good possibility that the SIM card may have moved a bit from its actual location. Eventually, there is poor contact between the SIM card pins and the circuit. Try inserting your SIM card properly with the following steps.

- Power off your Sony Xperia 5 V and with the help of Q pin, eject the SIM card holder from the SIM slot of your device.
- Now, grab a soft rubber pencil eraser and gently rub it in on the gold pins of SIM card to clean them properly. Then, with the help of a soft cloth wipe away the rubber residue from the SIM card.
- Next, push the SIM back into the SIM card holder properly and push it back into the SIM slot now.
- Turn your device back on and look if your SIM not provisioned on the Android issue is resolved or not.

### 2.4 Activate the SIM card

Usually, when you buy a new SIM card, it gets automatically activated within 24 hours of being plugged into a new device. But if that’s not happening in your case and you’re wondering how to activate SIM card, make use of the three options below to enable activation:

- Call your carrier service provider
- Send an SMS
- Log on to your carrier’s website and look for the activation page over it.

Note: The aforementioned options are straightforward and are quick ways to enable activation. It depends on your carrier network whether they support them.

### 2.5 Contact your carrier

Even if your SIM isn’t activated, grab another working device to make a phone call to your carrier or network. Ensure, to explain the entire situation and the error message to them. Be patient while they investigate the issue. It may eat up a heck load of time or may get resolved in a few minutes that completely depend upon the complexity of the issue.
