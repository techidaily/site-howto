## Part 6. Connect to another Wi-Fi

In some cases, you may be trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network that’s not very stable. This may keep cutting the connection to your device, which in turn is causing Snapchat to crash on Android.

To resolve this, you can simply try connecting to another Wi-Fi network or a data plan to see whether this is the problem. If so, changing network and then using the Snapchat app should stop any error messages from occurring.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Samsung Galaxy S24+, followed by the Wi-Fi option.

If you’re running a custom Android ROM on your device, with some versions of the ROM and some apps, you’re going to experience errors simply because of the way the apps and the ROMs are coded and designed.

Unfortunately, there’s no easy fix to this, and if you want to continue using the app, you’ll need to reflash your Samsung Galaxy S24+ back to its original firmware, and then wait until the ROM developers update the ROM to be compatible with social apps like Snapchat.

However, this reflashing process is simple thanks to the Dr.Fone - System Repair (Android) software that we listed above. To follow the detailed step-by-step guide, follow the steps on Part 4 of this article, or follow the quick guide instructions below.

One of the last resorts you can take is factory resetting your Samsung Galaxy S24+ back to its original settings. From the day you first started using your device, you’ve been using the system and downloading files and apps, and over time this increases the chances of creating a bug.

However, by resetting your device to factory settings, you can reset these bugs and get your apps and device working again free from the Unfortunately, Snapchat has stopped error message. Here’s how to factory reset your device.

Make sure you back up your personal files from your device first like your photos and music files because factory resetting your device will clear your device’s memory.

**Step 1:** Tap the Settings menu on your device and click the Backup and Reset option.

**Step 2:** Click the Reset Phone option. That’s it! The phone will take several minutes to complete the process, after which your phone will be reset to its original state.
