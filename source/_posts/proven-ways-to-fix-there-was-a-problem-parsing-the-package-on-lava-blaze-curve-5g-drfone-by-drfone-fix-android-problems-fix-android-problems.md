1. Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights
2. While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem

![wifi not working on android - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg)

If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Lava Blaze Curve 5G itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.

## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

If you’re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, you’ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Lava Blaze Curve 5G itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.

You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.

1. If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection
2. If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Lava Blaze Curve 5G is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there
3. Whichever method you’re using, try disconnecting your Lava Blaze Curve 5G and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Lava Blaze Curve 5G needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Lava Blaze Curve 5G. Here’s how to check on your Lava Blaze Curve 5G to make sure everything is correct.

1. Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Lava Blaze Curve 5G
2. Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router
3. Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router
4. Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches

When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.

## Part 8. Check the Wi-Fi connectivity on another phone

![android phone not connecting to wifi - connectivity on another phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

When experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, it’s worth noting the problem might not be with your phone, but rather the Wi-Fi network itself. This is why it’s important to make sure you check the connection on another device.

Of course, if you’re already using another phone on your Wi-Fi network, you know this isn’t the case. However, if you’re not sure, here’s what you need to do;

1. Get another Android or iOS phone or tablet
2. Open the Settings menu and connect to the Wi-Fi network you’re having problems with
3. Enter the password and connect to the network
4. Open a web browser on the phone and try loading a web page
5. If the page loads, you know the Wi-Fi network isn’t the problem
6. If the page doesn’t load, you know you’ve got a problem with your Wi-Fi network

## Part 9. Change the password of the Wi-Fi

![android phone not connecting to wifi - password settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-password.jpg)

Each Wi-Fi network router will give the opportunity to choose and change the password you have to let devices connect to your network. It’s important you try changing this because you never know if someone else has accessed your network and could be blocking your device. Here’s how it works;

1. Log onto your computer and open your Wi-Fi settings
2. Depending on the brand and method of your individual router, navigate to the Wi-Fi password settings menu
3. Change the password to something complicated using all available digits and characters
4. Save the password and restart the router to disconnect all devices
5. Now connect your Lava Blaze Curve 5G to the router using the new password

## Part 10. Reset network settings on Android

![android phone not connecting to wifi - reset network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-network.jpg)

Just like the method above where you’ll be effectively resetting the network settings on your router, if this hasn’t worked, you’ll be able to reset the network settings on your Lava Blaze Curve 5G, hopefully removing the bugs and allowing you to connect.

Here’s how you can do this easily on your Lava Blaze Curve 5G;

1. From the home screen of your Lava Blaze Curve 5G, open the Settings menu
2. Tap the Backup & Reset option
3. Tap the Reset Network Settings option
4. Tap the Reset Network option
5. If you need to, enter the PIN number or passcode for the Android device, and the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device will confirm the reset has taken place
6. Reconnect your Lava Blaze Curve 5G to your Wi-Fi network for the changes to take effect

## Part 11. Clear partition cache in recovery mode

![wifi not working on android - clear partition](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-partitioncache.jpg)

As you continue to use your Lava Blaze Curve 5G, the partition cache will fill up with data your device needs and doesn’t need. However, by clearing your device’s partition cache, you can make clear up some space which should help your device have enough memory to connect to the internet.

1. Turn off your Lava Blaze Curve 5G
2. Turn it on by holding down the power button, volume button, and home button
3. When your phone vibrates, let go of the Power button, but continue to hold the volume button
4. When a menu is displayed, use the volume buttons to navigate the menu
5. Select the Android System Recovery option, followed by Wipe Cache Partition
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet

## Part 12. Reset factory settings

![wifi not working on android - factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-factory-reset.jpg)

If worse comes to worst, another option you have is to factory reset your Lava Blaze Curve 5G. As we’ve spoken about above, while using your phone from the day you started using it, your device will fill up with files and data which can become messy and causes bugs.

However, by factory resetting your device, you can start again from the factory default from which you first received it, ultimately clearing the bugs. Make sure you back up your device before proceeding because it will erase your personal files.

1. Open the Settings menu on your Lava Blaze Curve 5G
2. Navigate to System > Advanced > Reset Options
3. Tap the Reset phone option, and enter your PIN code if required
4. Tap Erase Everything
5. Wait for your phone to complete the process
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet
