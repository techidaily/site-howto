## Full Guide: How To Fix Connection Is Not Private on Poco C55

Are you encountering the "your connection is not private" issue on your phone? We found many Android users have increasingly expressed their frustrations with this recurring problem while browsing on the internet.

Usually, you can just reload the page to fix the error. But in case it doesn't help, you may need to look for more advanced solutions. In the following discussion, we will delve into why this **"your connection is not private" on Android** happens and explore solutions that work for you.

## Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android

First of all, what does **"your connection is not private" on Android** mean? To answer this question, it's essential to understand that this error is often associated with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol issues.

SSL is a cryptographic protocol created to establish a secure communication channel over the internet. Its primary purpose is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a user's device and a website's server.

The error message appears when there's a problem with the SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate of the website you are trying to access. This certificate is a digital document that authenticates the website and encrypts the data transmitted between the user's device and the server.

![Your connection is not private error on Android.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-1.jpg)

Some common factors that could trigger the **"your connection is not private" on Chrome Android error**:

1. **Expired or invalid SSL certificate of the website;**

Certificates are issued for a specific period, and if the website owner fails to renew it in time, your browser will detect it as not secure.

2. **There is a mismatch between the domain on the certificate and the actual domain you are trying to visit;**

This discrepancy might occur due to a misconfiguration on the website or, in some cases, due to a man-in-the-middle attack where a third party intercepts the communication between your device and the server.

3. **No HTTPS enforcement;**

Another reason for the issue is if the installed SSL certificate doesn't turn on the "force HTTPS" option. This means visitors might be using the non-secure HTTP version of the site instead of the safe URL.

So, the error serves as a warning to users, indicating that the connection may not be secure and sensitive information could be at risk.

Browsers, including those on Android devices, prioritize user safety and privacy. They will block access to potentially compromised websites to prevent data theft or unauthorized access. That's why when you get the "your connection is not private" message on Android, you can't access the website.

## Part 2: What The Error Codes in "Your Connection Is Not Private" Mean

When **"your connection is not private" on Chrome Android error** shows up, it often comes along with specific error codes that can indicate the root cause of the issue. Understanding these error codes is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving the problem effectively.

1. **ERR\_CERT\_SYMANTEC\_LEGACY: Unsupported Symantec-issued certificate**

This error code indicates that the website you are attempting to access is equipped with an unsupported Symantec-issued certificate. Symantec, a prominent Certificate Authority, had faced concerns about the security of its certificate issuance processes.

As a result, major browsers, including Google Chrome, no longer support certificates issued by Symantec. If you encounter this error, it implies that the website's SSL certificate is outdated and needs to be updated with a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.

2. **NET::ERR\_CERT\_AUTHORITY\_INVALID: Unauthenticated SSL certificate**

The presence of this error code suggests that the SSL certificate of the website cannot be authenticated by your browser. This could occur if the certificate is self-signed or issued by an unrecognized Certificate Authority.

3. **NET::ERR\_CERT\_DATE\_INVALID: Date and time mismatch**

This error code points to a discrepancy between your Poco C55's date and time settings and the information on the website's SSL certificate, as they have expiration dates. If the date and time settings on your device are incorrect, it may prevent the certificate from being validated. Correcting your device's date and time settings should resolve this issue.

4. **SSL certificate error: Generic or unspecified problem**

This is a more generic error message that indicates a problem with the website's SSL certificate without specifying the exact nature of the issue. It could indicate various issues, such as an expired certificate, a misconfiguration in the certificate chain, or other SSL-related problems.

## Part 3: How To Fix Your Connection Is Not Private on Android

Encountering the **"your connection is not private" error on Android** can be a frustrating experience. Fortunately, there are various methods to address and fix this issue, depending on its underlying cause.

Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.

However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.

![wifi not working on android - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg)

If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Poco C55 itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.

## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

If you’re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, you’ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Poco C55 itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.

You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.

1. If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Poco C55 device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection
2. If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Poco C55 is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Poco C55 needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Poco C55. Here’s how to check on your Poco C55 to make sure everything is correct.

1. Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Poco C55

## Part 8. Check the Wi-Fi connectivity on another phone

![android phone not connecting to wifi - connectivity on another phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

When experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, it’s worth noting the problem might not be with your phone, but rather the Wi-Fi network itself. This is why it’s important to make sure you check the connection on another device.

Of course, if you’re already using another phone on your Wi-Fi network, you know this isn’t the case. However, if you’re not sure, here’s what you need to do;

1. Get another Android or iOS phone or tablet
2. Open the Settings menu and connect to the Wi-Fi network you’re having problems with
3. Enter the password and connect to the network
4. Open a web browser on the phone and try loading a web page
5. If the page loads, you know the Wi-Fi network isn’t the problem
6. If the page doesn’t load, you know you’ve got a problem with your Wi-Fi network

## Part 9. Change the password of the Wi-Fi

![android phone not connecting to wifi - password settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-password.jpg)

Each Wi-Fi network router will give the opportunity to choose and change the password you have to let devices connect to your network. It’s important you try changing this because you never know if someone else has accessed your network and could be blocking your device. Here’s how it works;

1. Log onto your computer and open your Wi-Fi settings
2. Depending on the brand and method of your individual router, navigate to the Wi-Fi password settings menu
3. Change the password to something complicated using all available digits and characters
4. Save the password and restart the router to disconnect all devices
5. Now connect your Poco C55 to the router using the new password

## Part 10. Reset network settings on Android

![android phone not connecting to wifi - reset network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-network.jpg)

Just like the method above where you’ll be effectively resetting the network settings on your router, if this hasn’t worked, you’ll be able to reset the network settings on your Poco C55, hopefully removing the bugs and allowing you to connect.

Here’s how you can do this easily on your Poco C55;

1. From the home screen of your Poco C55, open the Settings menu
2. Tap the Backup & Reset option
3. Tap the Reset Network Settings option
4. Tap the Reset Network option
5. If you need to, enter the PIN number or passcode for the Android device, and the Poco C55 device will confirm the reset has taken place
6. Reconnect your Poco C55 to your Wi-Fi network for the changes to take effect

## Part 11. Clear partition cache in recovery mode

![wifi not working on android - clear partition](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-partitioncache.jpg)

As you continue to use your Poco C55, the partition cache will fill up with data your device needs and doesn’t need. However, by clearing your device’s partition cache, you can make clear up some space which should help your device have enough memory to connect to the internet.

1. Turn off your Poco C55
2. Turn it on by holding down the power button, volume button, and home button
3. When your phone vibrates, let go of the Power button, but continue to hold the volume button
4. When a menu is displayed, use the volume buttons to navigate the menu
5. Select the Android System Recovery option, followed by Wipe Cache Partition
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet

## Part 12. Reset factory settings

![wifi not working on android - factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-factory-reset.jpg)

If worse comes to worst, another option you have is to factory reset your Poco C55. As we’ve spoken about above, while using your phone from the day you started using it, your device will fill up with files and data which can become messy and causes bugs.

However, by factory resetting your device, you can start again from the factory default from which you first received it, ultimately clearing the bugs. Make sure you back up your device before proceeding because it will erase your personal files.

1. Open the Settings menu on your Poco C55
2. Navigate to System > Advanced > Reset Options
3. Tap the Reset phone option, and enter your PIN code if required
4. Tap Erase Everything
5. Wait for your phone to complete the process
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet
