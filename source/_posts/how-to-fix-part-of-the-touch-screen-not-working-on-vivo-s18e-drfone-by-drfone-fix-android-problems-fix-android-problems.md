Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Vivo S18e, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the "Backup & Restore" option on the screen.

Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup & Restore from the menu list.

Step 2: Press "Restore" to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created
