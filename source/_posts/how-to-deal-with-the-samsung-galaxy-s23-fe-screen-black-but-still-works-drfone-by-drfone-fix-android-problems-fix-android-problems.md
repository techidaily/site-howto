## Part 1: Why Did My Samsung Galaxy S23 FE Screen Go Black but Still Works? Common Causes

Experiencing a **cell phone blank screen** is not exclusive to Android or iOS users. A **phone screen not turning on** happens all the time due to several factors that may or may not be out of your control. While they can be frustrating, here are some common causes you should know as to why **your phone screen went black but still works.**

### A Drained Battery

The first thing that comes to mind when your **phone screen suddenly goes black** is you have a drained battery.

An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.

### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software.

This can happen to various models, such as the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Samsung Galaxy S23 FE devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.
