## Full Guide: How To Fix Connection Is Not Private on OnePlus Nord 3 5G

Are you encountering the "your connection is not private" issue on your phone? We found many Android users have increasingly expressed their frustrations with this recurring problem while browsing on the internet.

Usually, you can just reload the page to fix the error. But in case it doesn't help, you may need to look for more advanced solutions. In the following discussion, we will delve into why this **"your connection is not private" on Android** happens and explore solutions that work for you.

## Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android

First of all, what does **"your connection is not private" on Android** mean? To answer this question, it's essential to understand that this error is often associated with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol issues.

SSL is a cryptographic protocol created to establish a secure communication channel over the internet. Its primary purpose is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a user's device and a website's server.

The error message appears when there's a problem with the SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate of the website you are trying to access. This certificate is a digital document that authenticates the website and encrypts the data transmitted between the user's device and the server.

![Your connection is not private error on Android.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-1.jpg)

Some common factors that could trigger the **"your connection is not private" on Chrome Android error**:

1. **Expired or invalid SSL certificate of the website;**

Certificates are issued for a specific period, and if the website owner fails to renew it in time, your browser will detect it as not secure.

2. **There is a mismatch between the domain on the certificate and the actual domain you are trying to visit;**

This discrepancy might occur due to a misconfiguration on the website or, in some cases, due to a man-in-the-middle attack where a third party intercepts the communication between your device and the server.

3. **No HTTPS enforcement;**

Another reason for the issue is if the installed SSL certificate doesn't turn on the "force HTTPS" option. This means visitors might be using the non-secure HTTP version of the site instead of the safe URL.

So, the error serves as a warning to users, indicating that the connection may not be secure and sensitive information could be at risk.

Browsers, including those on Android devices, prioritize user safety and privacy. They will block access to potentially compromised websites to prevent data theft or unauthorized access. That's why when you get the "your connection is not private" message on Android, you can't access the website.

## Part 2: What The Error Codes in "Your Connection Is Not Private" Mean

When **"your connection is not private" on Chrome Android error** shows up, it often comes along with specific error codes that can indicate the root cause of the issue. Understanding these error codes is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving the problem effectively.

1. **ERR\_CERT\_SYMANTEC\_LEGACY: Unsupported Symantec-issued certificate**

This error code indicates that the website you are attempting to access is equipped with an unsupported Symantec-issued certificate. Symantec, a prominent Certificate Authority, had faced concerns about the security of its certificate issuance processes.

As a result, major browsers, including Google Chrome, no longer support certificates issued by Symantec. If you encounter this error, it implies that the website's SSL certificate is outdated and needs to be updated with a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.

2. **NET::ERR\_CERT\_AUTHORITY\_INVALID: Unauthenticated SSL certificate**

The presence of this error code suggests that the SSL certificate of the website cannot be authenticated by your browser. This could occur if the certificate is self-signed or issued by an unrecognized Certificate Authority.

3. **NET::ERR\_CERT\_DATE\_INVALID: Date and time mismatch**

This error code points to a discrepancy between your OnePlus Nord 3 5G's date and time settings and the information on the website's SSL certificate, as they have expiration dates. If the date and time settings on your device are incorrect, it may prevent the certificate from being validated. Correcting your device's date and time settings should resolve this issue.

4. **SSL certificate error: Generic or unspecified problem**

This is a more generic error message that indicates a problem with the website's SSL certificate without specifying the exact nature of the issue. It could indicate various issues, such as an expired certificate, a misconfiguration in the certificate chain, or other SSL-related problems.

## Part 3: How To Fix Your Connection Is Not Private on Android

![fix wifi keep disconnecting android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/why-does-my-phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi.jpg)

Since everything revolves around the internet, it's annoying if your WI-FI disconnects. You might question yourself **why does my Wi-Fi keep disconnecting from the phone**? To know the answer, read the article below.

## Part 1: Why Does Your Phone Keep Disconnecting from WiFi?

Is your phone frequently getting disconnected from Wi-Fi? Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the OnePlus Nord 3 5G devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:

- **Router Problems**

If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.

- **Out of Wi-Fi Range**

**Why does My OnePlus Nord 3 5G keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi**? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.

- **Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked**

The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.

- **Devices Connected with Router**

Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.

- **Unstable Internet**

If your OnePlus Nord 3 5G gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.

Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.

## Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone

### Fix 2: Check Router Settings

If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings.

**Step 1**: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.

![tap on your wifi option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg)

### Fix 4: Restart Your Router

As we discussed, to restart your phone, you can also restart the router to get rid of the problem. For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start.

### Fix 5: Forget Old Networks

The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.

**Step 1**: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.

### Fix 6. Check Recently Installed Applications

Sometimes, different installed applications can also cause trouble. If your Wi-Fi was fine, but suddenly it started disconnecting, then don’t forget to check the recently installed apps. This is because with not knowing the damage it can cause, you might have installed some VPNs, connections boosters, or firewalls. You can try and disable them but if that doesn’t resolve the problem, then uninstall the app.

**Step 1**: For uninstalling the problematic application, you have to select it and hold it. You will see a pop-up menu of multiple options; choose the option of ‘Uninstall' to remove the app from the phone.

![tap on uninstall button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-9.jpg)

### Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone

It’s annoying that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting while you are working or studying. Android users can easily get over this problem by resetting the network settings. The steps for this fix are as follows:

**Step 1**: For resetting the network, start by opening the ‘Settings’ menu on your phone. Then, scroll down, look for the 'Connection & Sharing' option, and select it.

![access connect and sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-10.jpg)

**Step 4**: After providing the appropriate clearances, you will be asked for another confirmation of resetting the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device’s networks to default. Click “OK” to execute.

![tap on ok button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-13.jpg)

### Fix 8: Check Routers Range

If your Wi-Fi automatically disconnects and connects again while you are roaming in the house, then it is because of the router's range; you should check it. For this, you can consider changing and modifying your AP (Access Point) band on your router.

Although the 5GHz frequency band is recognized for providing better network speeds, this band has a shorter range as compared to the 2.4GHz band, which has a better coverage of area. You can easily shift your router’s range through its configuration page. It is considered optimal to utilize the 2.4GHz frequency band for better ranges.

![change routers range](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-14.jpg)

### Fix 9: Stay Connected while Asleep

**Step 1**: Start by opening the ‘Settings’ menu on your phone. Then scroll down until you find the 'Battery' option and open it.

![open battery settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-15.jpg)
