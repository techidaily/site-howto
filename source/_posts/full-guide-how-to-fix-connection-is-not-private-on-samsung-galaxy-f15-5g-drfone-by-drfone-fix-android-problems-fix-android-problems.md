## Full Guide: How To Fix Connection Is Not Private on Samsung Galaxy F15 5G

Are you encountering the "your connection is not private" issue on your phone? We found many Android users have increasingly expressed their frustrations with this recurring problem while browsing on the internet.

Usually, you can just reload the page to fix the error. But in case it doesn't help, you may need to look for more advanced solutions. In the following discussion, we will delve into why this **"your connection is not private" on Android** happens and explore solutions that work for you.

## Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android

First of all, what does **"your connection is not private" on Android** mean? To answer this question, it's essential to understand that this error is often associated with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol issues.

SSL is a cryptographic protocol created to establish a secure communication channel over the internet. Its primary purpose is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a user's device and a website's server.

The error message appears when there's a problem with the SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate of the website you are trying to access. This certificate is a digital document that authenticates the website and encrypts the data transmitted between the user's device and the server.

![Your connection is not private error on Android.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-1.jpg)

Some common factors that could trigger the **"your connection is not private" on Chrome Android error**:

1. **Expired or invalid SSL certificate of the website;**

Certificates are issued for a specific period, and if the website owner fails to renew it in time, your browser will detect it as not secure.

2. **There is a mismatch between the domain on the certificate and the actual domain you are trying to visit;**

This discrepancy might occur due to a misconfiguration on the website or, in some cases, due to a man-in-the-middle attack where a third party intercepts the communication between your device and the server.

3. **No HTTPS enforcement;**

Another reason for the issue is if the installed SSL certificate doesn't turn on the "force HTTPS" option. This means visitors might be using the non-secure HTTP version of the site instead of the safe URL.

So, the error serves as a warning to users, indicating that the connection may not be secure and sensitive information could be at risk.

Browsers, including those on Android devices, prioritize user safety and privacy. They will block access to potentially compromised websites to prevent data theft or unauthorized access. That's why when you get the "your connection is not private" message on Android, you can't access the website.

## Part 2: What The Error Codes in "Your Connection Is Not Private" Mean

When **"your connection is not private" on Chrome Android error** shows up, it often comes along with specific error codes that can indicate the root cause of the issue. Understanding these error codes is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving the problem effectively.

1. **ERR\_CERT\_SYMANTEC\_LEGACY: Unsupported Symantec-issued certificate**

This error code indicates that the website you are attempting to access is equipped with an unsupported Symantec-issued certificate. Symantec, a prominent Certificate Authority, had faced concerns about the security of its certificate issuance processes.

As a result, major browsers, including Google Chrome, no longer support certificates issued by Symantec. If you encounter this error, it implies that the website's SSL certificate is outdated and needs to be updated with a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.

2. **NET::ERR\_CERT\_AUTHORITY\_INVALID: Unauthenticated SSL certificate**

The presence of this error code suggests that the SSL certificate of the website cannot be authenticated by your browser. This could occur if the certificate is self-signed or issued by an unrecognized Certificate Authority.

3. **NET::ERR\_CERT\_DATE\_INVALID: Date and time mismatch**

This error code points to a discrepancy between your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G's date and time settings and the information on the website's SSL certificate, as they have expiration dates. If the date and time settings on your device are incorrect, it may prevent the certificate from being validated. Correcting your device's date and time settings should resolve this issue.

4. **SSL certificate error: Generic or unspecified problem**

This is a more generic error message that indicates a problem with the website's SSL certificate without specifying the exact nature of the issue. It could indicate various issues, such as an expired certificate, a misconfiguration in the certificate chain, or other SSL-related problems.

## Part 3: How To Fix Your Connection Is Not Private on Android

## Samsung Galaxy F15 5G Camera Not Working Unexpected Error? Fix It Now

So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today.

Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.

![camera not working error in android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg)

## Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?

There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G.

**Low Memory**

Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.

**Low Storage**

The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.

**General Bugs And Glitches**

OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.

**Hardware Issues**

In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.

## Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?

So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G right where you are, without needing to take the Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device to the manufacturer’s service center.

### II.I: Restart The Handset

One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.

![restarting android handset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg)

Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.

### II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App

If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.

Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.

![closing apps in app switcher](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg)

Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.

### II.III: Check App Permissions

These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera > Permissions.

![camera permissions check android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Camera.

![set camera permissions android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg)

Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.

### II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache

Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera and tap Storage Usage.

![clear camera app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

![clear camera app cache android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg)

### II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache

The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Photos > Storage Usage.

![clear photo gallery app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

### II.VI: Check For App Updates

This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.

Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.

![google play store app updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.

![check for app updates play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg)

Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.

### II.VII: Cool The Phone Down

We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.

If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.

### II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System

You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.

### II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)

Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre. And, we have just the app to help you fix your camera not working on Android problem quickly.
