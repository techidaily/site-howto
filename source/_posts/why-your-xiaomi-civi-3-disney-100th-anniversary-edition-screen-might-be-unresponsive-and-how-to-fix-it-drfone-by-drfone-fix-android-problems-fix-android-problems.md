Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.
