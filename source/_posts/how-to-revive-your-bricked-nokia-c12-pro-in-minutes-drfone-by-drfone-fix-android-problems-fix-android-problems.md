## What Causes A Nokia C12 Pro Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Nokia C12 Pro phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Nokia C12 Pro screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.
