### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending.

### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your Infinix Note 30 5G in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.
