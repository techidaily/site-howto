### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Honor Magic 6 Pro black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

After fully discharging the battery, the Honor Magic 6 Pro device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Honor Magic 6 Pro device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Honor Magic 6 Pro Y2 and Honor Magic 6 Pro 5A.
