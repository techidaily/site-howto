## Reliable User Guide to Fix Infinix Zero 30 5G Running Slow and Freezing

Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.

However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the **Android phone is running slow and freezing** over time. There can be many potential reasons why **Android phone runs slow** suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.

In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Infinix Zero 30 5G device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Infinix Zero 30 5G device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Infinix Zero 30 5G device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Infinix Zero 30 5G contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Infinix Zero 30 5G device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Infinix Zero 30 5G device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Infinix Zero 30 5G is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Infinix Zero 30 5G is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Infinix Zero 30 5Gs.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Infinix Zero 30 5G is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Infinix Zero 30 5G device. So if your Infinix Zero 30 5G is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Infinix Zero 30 5G device’s animation type and speed on your Infinix Zero 30 5G via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Infinix Zero 30 5G to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Infinix Zero 30 5G is running slow and freezing, the Infinix Zero 30 5G device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues

Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Infinix Zero 30 5G device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Infinix Zero 30 5G is running slow and freezing.

### Your Internet Connection is Unstable

Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too. Most apps today rely heavily on the internet to execute some tasks like communicating and streaming. So don’t panic when your Infinix Zero 30 5G is running slow and freezing. It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.

## What to Do When My Infinix Zero 30 5G Lags?

It’s not as bad as the black screen of death when the Android phone runs slow. However, it can still cause some delays and inconvenience for users. So it’s really important to take action when you notice some anomalies with its speed and performance. Below are some remedies that can help you get rid of this issue.

## Part 1: Clear the cache of Settings and Google Play Service

It is possible that the corrupted cache files are responsible for this error. Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:

1. Open “Settings” on your Infinix Zero 30 5G and choose “Apps & Notifications”/”Apps”/”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).
2. In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.
3. Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.

![settings crashing - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg)

Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”. Therefore, go accordingly without getting confused.

## Part 2: Clear the Android phone’s RAM and retry

As the next tip, we would like to suggest you clear your device’s RAM by ceasing the running apps in the background. RAM, if at the increased level, is responsible for the Infinix Zero 30 5G device’s freezing, poor performance, and most probably is the reason behind crashing Settings.
