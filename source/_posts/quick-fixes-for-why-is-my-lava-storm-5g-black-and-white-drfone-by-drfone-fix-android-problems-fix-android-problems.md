If you’re trying to take a screenshot of an app or website with a security policy in place, there’s usually no way to circumvent it. However, there are a few things you can do to take pictures of these apps and website content.

Enable Screen Capture on Android

Sudden “**can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” notifications, failing to take a screenshot, and a Lava Storm 5G user?

If you are using this Android device, you can enable the screen capture feature in the Settings app.

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** > **Apps**, then tap the **More options** icon in the upper right corner.

Once you have enabled screen capture, you can check if you can take screenshots of any app or website.

Enable Screenshots in Incognito Mode

Apps and websites may prohibit screenshots in incognito mode to protect your privacy. However, you can enable the Incognito Screenshot experimental flag in Chrome to bypass this restriction.

- **Step 1:** Open Chrome on your Lava Storm 5G and type “chrome://flags” in the address bar.

- **Step 2:** Search for Incognito Screenshot and choose **Enabled** from the drop-down menu.

- **Step 3:** Tap **Relaunch** on the lower right corner of the screen.

Once Chrome has relaunched, you should be able to take screenshots in incognito mode by pressing the power and volume-down buttons at the same time.

Use Google Assistant

With Google Assistant, taking screenshots on your Lava Storm 5G is now easier than ever. Just say, “Hey, Google, take a screenshot,” Google Assistant will capture the screen and save it to your gallery.

Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots

You can download several applications on Google Play Store if you still can’t take a screenshot due to security policy. Some popular third-party screenshot apps include:

- Screenshot Easy
- Screenshot Tile
- Screen Master: Screenshot Markup

Third-party screenshot apps often use different methods to capture the screen. These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.

Capture Your Phone Display With Another Device

If you own another smartphone, you can use it to take a photo of the screen of the Lava Storm 5G device you’re trying to take a screenshot of. This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.

Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions

Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.

Screen Mirroring

Smart View allows you to display your Lava Storm 5G device’s screen on your smart TV, where you can then take a screenshot of the TV to capture the app or website you need.

- **Step 1:** Swipe down the top of the screen to access the **Quick Settings** panel.
- **Step 2:** Tap the **Smart View** icon.
- **Step 3:** Select your TV from the list of available devices and tap **Start Now**.

Alternatively, if you don’t have a smart TV, you can still mirror your phone screen display to your desktop or tablet using the Lava Storm 5G Flow app and take a screenshot of your phone’s screen instead.

Use Disable Flag Secure Magisk Module

Still experiencing the error message, “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy?” Bypass Android** phone error like this using a module.

The module patches the Android framework to remove the FLAG\_SECURE flag from apps. It is a relatively simple process but requires root access and Magisk. This module will turn off the security flag to take screenshots in Incognito mode and other apps.

If an app is causing the error, you can try two things. First, remove the app’s screenshot restriction. Second, download a different screenshot app or a different device to take screenshots.
