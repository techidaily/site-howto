However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Itel P55 5G touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Itel P55 5G phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Itel P55 5G touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Itel P55 5G Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Itel P55 5G phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Itel P55 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Itel P55 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Itel P55 5G device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Itel P55 5G screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Itel P55 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Itel P55 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Itel P55 5G Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Itel P55 5G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Itel P55 5G black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

To restart a Itel P55 5G device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Itel P55 5Glogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely
