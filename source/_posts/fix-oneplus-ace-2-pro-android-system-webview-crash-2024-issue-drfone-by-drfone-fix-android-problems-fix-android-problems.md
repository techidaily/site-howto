### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.

### Update Gmail App

As the last tip that will indeed help you is to update the Gmail app. Until you update the app when required, Gmail keeps stopping you from working and you will definitely get frustrated. Therefore, go to Play Store and look for the Gmail update. If it is available, welcome it with smile and bid farewell to the problem of slow running Gmail.
