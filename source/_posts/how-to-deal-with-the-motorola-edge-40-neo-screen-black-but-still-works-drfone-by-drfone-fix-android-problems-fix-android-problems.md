Experiencing a **cell phone blank screen** is not exclusive to Android or iOS users. A **phone screen not turning on** happens all the time due to several factors that may or may not be out of your control. While they can be frustrating, here are some common causes you should know as to why **your phone screen went black but still works.**

### A Drained Battery

The first thing that comes to mind when your **phone screen suddenly goes black** is you have a drained battery.

### App Troubles

If your **phone is working, but the screen is black,** there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application. An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.

### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software. This problem suggests that your Motorola Edge 40 Neo is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately.

This can also cause a **black screen but your phone is still on.**
