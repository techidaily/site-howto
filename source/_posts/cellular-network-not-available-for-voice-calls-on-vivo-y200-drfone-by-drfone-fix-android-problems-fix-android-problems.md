## Part 1. Preliminary Reasons For Cellular Network Not Available For Voice Calls

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

### 3\. Network Congestion

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the Vivo Y200 device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.

### 5\. Battery or Power Issues

In some instances, [<u>insufficient battery power</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-your-phone-battery-health.html) or power-saving modes on devices can cause this issue.

1. **Software Glitch:** Android systems may experience temporary glitches due to factors like memory management issues, conflicts between apps or services, or system updates.
2. **Insufficient System Resources:** Low system storage is another reason for getting the error. If you have too many apps on your phone, then it might take a toll on its memory and generate the “process system isn’t responding” prompt.
3. **Third-Party Apps:** Users have also complained that they receive the "Android process system is not responding" error after installing a new app. If you have installed an app from a source other than Google Play Store, then the chances are that you can get this error. Though, even after installing an app from Play Store, there is a bleak probability of facing this issue as well.
4. **Outdated Software:** Using outdated apps, particularly system apps or critical components, may lead to compatibility issues with the latest Android version.
5. **System Updates:** Most of the time, it happens whenever a device is restarted after updating its Android version. Your device could have undergone a bad update or might have had an unsupported driver. This can result in the occurrence of **process system not responding** issue.
6. **Corrupt Cache Files:** Corrupted cache files can lead to conflicts and result in error.
7. **Overclocking or Modifications:** Rooting or modifying the Android device, or applying overclocking settings, can lead to instability and the process system not responding error.
8. **Hardware Issues:** Rarely, hardware problems like failing components can interfere with the proper functioning of the system.

No matter what the cause is, there are plenty of ways to overcome this issue. We have listed a handful of them in this post.
