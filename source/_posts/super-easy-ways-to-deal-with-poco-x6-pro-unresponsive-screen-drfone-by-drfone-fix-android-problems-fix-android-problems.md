Poco X6 Pro cell phones are presently utilized for perusing the Internet and exploring through maps, photography, videography, and numerous other used cases. A development in arranged availability goes hand-in-hand with the development of cell phones.

Poco X6 Pro smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Poco X6 Pro touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Poco X6 Pro phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen. In this guide, you'll find the information you need to troubleshoot and fix the most common problems reported by Motorola customers.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Poco X6 Pro device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Poco X6 Pro smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Poco X6 Pro 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

### **There might be issues with the Poco X6 Pro device itself**

Screens on Poco X6 Pro devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every Poco X6 Pro device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.

### **There might be errors in the updated software**

The Android operating system is adjustable. Some of our technological advancements may backfire on us. The phone won't power on or become stuck in a boot loop where the logo will only show intermittently. For example, some Poco X6 Pro 4 and 5 users have reported their screens are unresponsive after a software update, rendering the Poco X6 Pro device unusable.

## Part 1. Preliminary Reasons For Cellular Network Not Available For Voice Calls

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

### 3\. Network Congestion

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the Poco X6 Pro device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.

### 5\. Battery or Power Issues

In some instances, [<u>insufficient battery power</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-your-phone-battery-health.html) or power-saving modes on devices can cause this issue.
