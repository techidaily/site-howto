Xiaomi 13 Ultra smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Xiaomi 13 Ultra touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Xiaomi 13 Ultra phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Xiaomi 13 Ultra smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery.
