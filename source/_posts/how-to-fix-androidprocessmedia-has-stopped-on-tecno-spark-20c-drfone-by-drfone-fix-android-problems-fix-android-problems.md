## Part 3. How to Fix "Android. Process. Media" Error

With a full backup of your Tecno Spark 20C, you can now embark on a mission to fix the error. There are several methods to clear this error. We have outlined three of the most effective solutions here.

### Method 1: Ensure app and system updates

Updates often include patches for known issues and vulnerabilities. Ensuring that both apps and the system are up to date can resolve many potential problems.

Step 1: Visit the Google Play Store to check for available app updates.

Step 2: In "Settings," go to "System" > "Software Update" to check for system updates.

### Method 2: Reset app preferences

App preference settings might sometimes lead to conflicts or anomalies. Resetting these settings can revert apps to their default state, resolving potential issues.

Step 1: Go to "Settings" on your device.

Step 2: Access "Apps."

Step 3: Tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner and select "Reset App Preferences."

### Method 3: Clear the cache and data on your device

Step 1: Go to Settings> Applications> Manage Applications and find the Google Services framework.

Step 2: Next, find Google Play from the same Manage Applications page.

Step 3: Tap on it and then Tap on clear cache.

![clear crash](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-process-media-02.jpg)

Step 4: Press the back button to go back to the Google Services framework and then choose Force stop > clear cache > OK

### Method 4: Check Google Sync & Media Storage settings

### Method 5: Boot your device into safe mode

[Safe mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html) can temporarily disable third-party apps, allowing only core system apps. This detects if a third-party app causes the "Android process media keeps stopping" error. If the problem disappears in safe mode, a third-party app might be the cause. Uninstalling it can restore normal function. If the problem persists in safe mode, a deeper system issue might exist, needing further investigation or support.

## Why Is My Tecno Spark 20C Offline? Troubleshooting Guide

Ever had your Tecno Spark 20C claim it's offline, leaving you scratching your head about where it went wrong? We get it; it's confusing. That's why this article is here to untangle the mystery.

In the following sections, we're diving into the **"why is My Tecno Spark 20C offline"** dilemma that many Android users face. We'll break down the possible reasons behind this common issue and guide you through simple steps on how to fix it. By the end of the article, you’ll be able to get back to smooth internet surfing on your Tecno Spark 20C. Let’s get started.

## Part 1: Why Does My Tecno Spark 20C Say Offline?

When you encounter the “offline” error message, it can disrupt your usual smartphone activities. Suddenly, you find yourself unable to browse the internet, send or receive emails, or stay connected through instant messages.

It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Tecno Spark 20C showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Tecno Spark 20C. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

2. **Internet connection issues**

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My Tecno Spark 20C offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.

3. **Glitches or bugs**

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Tecno Spark 20C can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

4. **Firewall restrictions**

In some cases, a firewall on your Tecno Spark 20C might be overly restrictive, preventing the Tecno Spark 20C device from establishing a connection to the internet. This security measure, intended to protect your device, can sometimes go overboard and disrupt normal online functionality.

Now, you have understood the potential causes as the first step toward resolving the issue. Next, we'll guide you through the process of troubleshooting and getting your Tecno Spark 20C back online.

![Phone offline on Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/why-is-my-phone-offline-1.jpg)

## Part 2: How To Fix “Phone Offline” With Internet Connection Problem

Now that we've figured out why your phone says it's offline, let's tackle the issue head-on. If you're facing problems like downloads that won't start, Google Play stuck on "Loading…," or web pages refusing to load, chances are it's an internet connection issue causing the problem.

Here are some easy solutions to get your connection back.

### Solution 1: Change connection to mobile data

Switching to mobile data can be a quick fix if your Wi-Fi is acting up. It ensures a change in your connection source and might resolve the "Phone offline" issue. Follow these easy steps to change your connection to mobile data:

![Change connection to mobile data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/why-is-my-phone-offline-2.jpg)

### Solution 2: On and off Airplane mode

[<u>Airplane Mode</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location.html) can sometimes cause connectivity confusion. Turning it off and on essentially resets your phone's wireless connections, which might resolve the offline issue.

![On and off the Airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/why-is-my-phone-offline-3.jpg)

### Solution 3: Reset network settings

Resetting network settings can help eliminate any configuration glitches that might be causing the phone offline problem. It's like giving your phone's connection settings a fresh start.

- **Step 1:** Open your phone's Settings > Connection & sharing.

### Solution 4: Restart your Wi-Fi router

Sometimes, the problem might not be with your phone but rather with the [<u>Wi-Fi router</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/root/wifi-hacker-without-root.html). Restarting it can refresh the connection and potentially resolve the connectivity problem.

How to restart your Wi-Fi router:

- **Step 1:** Locate your Wi-Fi router.

- **Step 3:** Wait for about 10–15 seconds before plugging the router back in or turning it on.
