### Try Alternative Gmail Address

### Check Network Connection

As already mentioned, be sure of an active internet connection while working with Gmail. When you are not using a stable connection, it may lead to stuck on sending, Gmail crashing and many other issues. You can fix the issue by doing these three things:

1. Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.
2. Turn off Wi-Fi and then turn it on again after nearly 5 seconds. Do the same with the router. Plug it out and the plug in.
3. Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.

Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.

### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending. If these are not so important, you can remove them and send the mail. Or if it is not possible to send the mail without attachments, compressing the files can be a solution.

## Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue

### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your Lava Blaze 2 5G in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.

### Update Gmail App

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Lava Blaze 2 5G black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Lava Blaze 2 5G's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Lava Blaze 2 5G device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Lava Blaze 2 5G device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Lava Blaze 2 5Glogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Lava Blaze 2 5G device from functioning correctly.

After fully discharging the battery, the Lava Blaze 2 5G device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

If restarting the Lava Blaze 2 5G device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Lava Blaze 2 5G device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Lava Blaze 2 5G Y2 and Lava Blaze 2 5G 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance
