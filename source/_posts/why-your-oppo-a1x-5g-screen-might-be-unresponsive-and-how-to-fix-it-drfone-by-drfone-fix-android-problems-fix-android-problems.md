This can happen to various models, such as the Oppo A1x 5G, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Oppo A1x 5G device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Oppo A1x 5G F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Oppo A1x 5G device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Oppo A1x 5G device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
