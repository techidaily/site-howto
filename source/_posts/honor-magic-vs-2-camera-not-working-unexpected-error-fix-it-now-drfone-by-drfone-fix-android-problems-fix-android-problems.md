![camera not working error in android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg)

## Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?

There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Honor Magic Vs 2.

**Low Memory**

Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.

**Low Storage**

The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.

**General Bugs And Glitches**

OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.

**Hardware Issues**

In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Honor Magic Vs 2. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.

## Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?

So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Honor Magic Vs 2 right where you are, without needing to take the Honor Magic Vs 2 device to the manufacturer’s service center.

### II.I: Restart The Handset

One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Honor Magic Vs 2 device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.

![restarting android handset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg)

Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.

### II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App

If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.

Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.

![closing apps in app switcher](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg)

Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.

### II.III: Check App Permissions

These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera > Permissions.

![camera permissions check android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Camera.

![set camera permissions android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg)

Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.

### II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache

Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera and tap Storage Usage.

![clear camera app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

![clear camera app cache android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg)

### II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache

The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Photos > Storage Usage.

![clear photo gallery app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

### II.VI: Check For App Updates

This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.

Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.

![google play store app updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.

![check for app updates play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg)

Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.

### II.VII: Cool The Phone Down

We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.

If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.

### II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System

You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.

### II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)

Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre. And, we have just the app to help you fix your camera not working on Android problem quickly.

## Fix App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Problem on Honor Magic Vs 2

Mobile applications are important for smooth operations when it comes to smartphones. They offer convenience, entertainment, and functionality at your fingertips. However, encountering the "**App Not Available in Your Country Play Store**" issue can be frustrating. It can quickly dampen the excitement of discovering a new app.

This is mainly due to geographical restrictions that are often imposed by developers. It poses a hurdle for users eager to access a particular application. However, there is no need to worry, as this article will help you in resolving this issue. It will delve into effective strategies and solutions to ensure the unavailability of an app is no longer an obstacle.

## Part 1: Reasons Behind the App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Issue

Encountering the "**Google Play App Not Available in Your Country**" issue can feel like hitting a roadblock. This restriction hampers your ability to explore and use valuable apps. It can also disrupt the smooth functioning of your daily digital activities. Before going for solutions, it is crucial to understand the reasons causing this restriction in installing apps on smartphones:

### 1\. Regional Restrictions

One of the primary culprits behind this issue is the regional restrictions imposed by developers. Developers often roll out their apps gradually across different regions. It is done to adhere to legal and licensing requirements. This staggered release strategy ensures compliance with local laws. Moreover, it guarantees a smooth user experience tailored to specific geographical locations.

### 2\. Licensing and Legal Constraints

Licensing agreements and legal constraints play an important role when it comes to the accessibility of apps. Developers may encounter licensing issues. This can prevent them from offering their apps in certain regions. It is due to copyright, trademark, or other legal considerations. Navigating the complex web of international laws and agreements is a big hassle. It becomes a determining factor in the availability of apps on the Play Store.

### 3\. Localization Challenges

Apps are often designed with specific markets in mind. These incorporate language, cultural, and regulatory considerations to enhance user experience. The absence of proper localization can render an app incompatible with specific regions. It includes factors such as adapting the app for different languages, currencies, and cultural nuances. This can result in the app being excluded from the **Play Store app not available in your country.**

### 4\. Device and OS Compatibility

The compatibility between the app, the user's device, and its OS is another factor that contributes to this issue. Developers might restrict their app availability to certain devices or OS versions. It can restrict access for users whose devices or OS do not meet the app's requirements. This technical limitation adds another layer to the complexity of app availability.

### 5\. Political and Economic Factors

In some instances, political tensions or economic considerations can also be a factor. It may influence the accessibility of apps in certain countries. Geo-political factors, trade sanctions, or economic conditions can impact the distribution of apps. This leads developers to exclude specific regions from their app's availability.

### Method 1: Change Your Google Play Store Country

One of the most direct ways to address this issue is by manually adjusting your Google Play Store country settings. Google allows users to change their country or region.

The other option is to provide a payment method originating from that particular region. Below is a detailed walkthrough for this procedure:

- **Step 1.** Launch the Google Play Store on your Honor Magic Vs 2 and tap the “Profile” icon from the top right corner. Here, choose "Settings" and follow on to tap "General."

### Method 2: Use a Reliable VPN

Confronting the message "**This app is not accessible in your country" on the Play Store**? Employing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be an effective strategy. It allows you to virtually transcend geographical restrictions. A VPN masks your actual location by routing your internet connection through servers in different regions.

You can utilize a reliable VPN to access the Play Store as though you were in a region where the desired app is accessible. Follow this step-by-step guide to address this concern:

- **Step 1.** Access the Google Play Store and download a reliable VPN for the procedure. Open the VPN you download and connect to the country of your choice. Once you have connected your device’s IP to another country using the VPN, continue to your home screen.
