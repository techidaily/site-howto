## What Causes A Vivo X100 Pro Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Vivo X100 Pro phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Vivo X100 Pro screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Vivo X100 Pro Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Vivo X100 Pro device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Vivo X100 Pro screens to become unresponsive.

These issues can also occur in any Vivo X100 Pro model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Vivo X100 Pro Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector.

### 1. Restart The Device

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Vivo X100 Pro black screen problem.

- **Step 2:** Click the **“Install zip from sdcard”** button. Then, select the ZIP file that contains the ROM. Finally, click the **"reboot system now"** button.
