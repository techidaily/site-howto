## Part 5. Check for the Android update

![snapchat stopping - check for android update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-update-firmware.png)

Similar to some of the other solutions we’ve listed above, if you’re using an outdated version of the Android operating system, but the latest version of Snapchat is coded to the most recent, this can be a cause for the Snapchat crashing on Android problem to occur.

Fortunately, it’s easy to check to make sure you’re running the latest version of Android and to download and install the update if you need it. Here’s how, which will help to sort out your Snapchat keeps crashing Android problems.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Motorola Moto G24 and select the About Phone option.

## Part 6. Connect to another Wi-Fi

In some cases, you may be trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network that’s not very stable. This may keep cutting the connection to your device, which in turn is causing Snapchat to crash on Android.

To resolve this, you can simply try connecting to another Wi-Fi network or a data plan to see whether this is the problem. If so, changing network and then using the Snapchat app should stop any error messages from occurring.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Motorola Moto G24, followed by the Wi-Fi option.

## Part 7. Stop using the custom ROM

![snapchat stopping - stop rom](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-custom-rom.jpg)

If you’re running a custom Android ROM on your device, with some versions of the ROM and some apps, you’re going to experience errors simply because of the way the apps and the ROMs are coded and designed.

Unfortunately, there’s no easy fix to this, and if you want to continue using the app, you’ll need to reflash your Motorola Moto G24 back to its original firmware, and then wait until the ROM developers update the ROM to be compatible with social apps like Snapchat.

Step 1 - Go to the application that you got the error with.

![error code 920-turn off wifi](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022435219.jpg)

#### **METHOD 4: Clearing the cache and data of Google Play Store**

After doing this step clear your task manager (delete all recent applications). Go to play store and resume your download or update.

#### **METHOD 5: Removing and adding back your Google account**

It is best if you follow the order of the methods mentioned. Like, try each method in the given order until you get rid of the play store error 920.
