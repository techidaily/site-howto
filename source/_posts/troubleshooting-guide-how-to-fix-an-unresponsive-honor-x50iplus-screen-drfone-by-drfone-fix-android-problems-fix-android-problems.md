You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.

3\. SD Card not mounted in the Honor X50i+ device

Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.
