However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Motorola Edge 40 Neo touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Motorola Edge 40 Neo phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Motorola Edge 40 Neo touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Motorola Edge 40 Neo Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Motorola Edge 40 Neo phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Motorola Edge 40 Neo screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Motorola Edge 40 Neo Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Motorola Edge 40 Neo screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Motorola Edge 40 Neo model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Motorola Edge 40 Neo Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Motorola Edge 40 Neo Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Motorola Edge 40 Neo screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Motorola Edge 40 Neo model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Motorola Edge 40 Neo black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Motorola Edge 40 Neo's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Motorola Edge 40 Neo device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Motorola Edge 40 Neologo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.
