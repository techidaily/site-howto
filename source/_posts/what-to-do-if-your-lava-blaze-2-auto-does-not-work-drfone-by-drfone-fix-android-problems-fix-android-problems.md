- **Step 1:** Open Chrome on your Lava Blaze 2 and type “chrome://flags” in the address bar.

![chrome experimental flags](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-07.jpg)

Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots

Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions
