Poco C65 cell phones are presently utilized for perusing the Internet and exploring through maps, photography, videography, and numerous other used cases. A development in arranged availability goes hand-in-hand with the development of cell phones.

Poco C65 smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Poco C65 touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Poco C65 phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen. In this guide, you'll find the information you need to troubleshoot and fix the most common problems reported by Motorola customers.


## **What causes a Poco C65 Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Poco C65 phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Poco C65 device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Poco C65 smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Poco C65 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

### **There might be issues with the Poco C65 device itself**

Screens on Poco C65 devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every Poco C65 device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.

### **There might be errors in the updated software**

The Android operating system is adjustable. Some of our technological advancements may backfire on us. The phone won't power on or become stuck in a boot loop where the logo will only show intermittently. For example, some Poco C65 4 and 5 users have reported their screens are unresponsive after a software update, rendering the Poco C65 device unusable.

## **The common solutions to solve a Poco C65 Screen unresponsive**

Could anything be more annoying than a broken touchscreen on your Poco C65 phone? If this happens, the gadget is useless, and you won't be able to do even the simplest tasks. Even so, it's common for the screen to cease responding to touches.

Before taking the item in for repairs, see if you can figure out the problem independently. Do you want to learn the method? If the touch screens on your Poco C65 stop working, don’t panic; we'll teach you exactly what to do.

### **Solution 1: Try to restart your device**

**Step 1:** Press and hold the **power button** until the screen becomes black;

**Step 2:** After 1 minute or so, hold the **power button** again to power on the Poco C65 device.

### **Solution 2: Check your charging port and battery**

![xiaomi battery and charger](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/charge-your-phone.jpg)

If the battery of your Poco C65 is empty, your screen is expected to be unresponsive. To fix that, here are some easy steps for you:

1. Charge your phone.
2. Leave it for about an hour.
3. Come back to check. Turn your phone on.

### **Solution 3: Contact Customer Service**
