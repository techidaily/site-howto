Below are some possible causes of Samsung Galaxy A54 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot.

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G black screen problem.
