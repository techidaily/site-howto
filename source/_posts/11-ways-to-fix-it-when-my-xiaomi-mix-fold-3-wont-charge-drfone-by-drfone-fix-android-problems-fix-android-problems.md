If none of the above methods worked for you, the last resort you are left with is a factory reset. This method will wipe everything from your device and make it function like normal. We also suggest you [make a backup of your data](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html) if it is important so as to prevent the loss. Here is how to do this to fix the crashing Phone app.

1. Open "Settings" and go to the "Backup and Reset" option.
2. Look for "Factory data reset" and then tap on "Reset phone".
3. Within a while, your device will go through resetting and boot up to normalcy.
