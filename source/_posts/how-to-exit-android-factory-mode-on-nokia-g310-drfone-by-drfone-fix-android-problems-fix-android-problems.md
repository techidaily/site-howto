To know this and more about why the "Unfortunately, Phone has stopped" error crops up, read this article and get the problem sorted on your own.

- When you install a custom ROM, the issue might occur.
- The upgrading of the software or incomplete updates can lead to crashing the Phone app.
- Data crashes can be another reason why this error shows up.

## Part 2: 7 Fixes for the "Unfortunately, Phone Has Stopped" error

### 2.1 Open the Phone app in Safe Mode

First and foremost, the thing that can let you get rid of this trouble is Safe Mode. It is a feature that will end any excessive background functioning of the Nokia G310 device. For instance, your device will be able to run sans any third-party apps when in Safe mode. Since the important functions and the naïve apps will be running on the Nokia G310 device, you will get to know if it’s really a software glitch or not by running the Phone app in Safe mode. And this is the first solution we would recommend you make use of when the Phone app has stopped. Here is how to enable Safe Mode.

1. Switch off the Nokia G310 phone first.
2. Now keep pressing the "Power" button until you see the Nokia G310 logo on the screen.
3. Release the button and immediately press and hold the "Volume Down" key.
4. Leave the key once the Nokia G310 device is in Safe mode. Now, the third-party apps will be disabled and you can check if the Phone app is still not responding or everything is fine.

### 2.2 Clear the cache of the Phone app

The cache should be cleaned timely if you want any app to work properly. Due to the constant usage, the temporary files get collected and may corrupt if not cleared. Hence, the next solution you should try when the Phone app keeps stopping is to clear the cache. Here are the steps to be performed.

1. Open "Settings" on your device and go to "Application" or "Apps".
2. Now from the list of all applications, go to "Phone" and tap on it.

![Phone app crashing - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-phone.jpg)

### 2.3 Update Google Play services

Since Android is created by Google, there must be some Google Play services that are crucial to run several system functions. And if attempting the previous methods isn’t of any use, try updating Google Play services when you find the Phone app stopped. For doing this, you need to make sure that automatic updates are turned on in Google settings. If not, enable it and get the apps including Google Play services updated for smoother functions.

### 2.4 Update the Nokia G310 firmware

When the firmware is not updated, it may conflict with some apps and maybe that’s why your Phone app falls prey. Therefore, updating Nokia G310 firmware will be a sane step that should be taken when the Phone app has stopped. Follow the below-mentioned steps and then check if the Phone app is opening or not.

1. Open "Settings" and go to "About Device".
2. Now tap on "Software Updates" and check for the availability of the new update.

![Phone app crashing - update firmware](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/samsung-android-update-shot.jpg)

1. Switch off your device to begin with and enter the recovery mode by pressing the "Home", "Power" and "Volume Up" buttons.

### 2.7 Factory reset

If none of the above methods worked for you, the last resort you are left with is a factory reset. This method will wipe everything from your device and make it function like normal. We also suggest you [make a backup of your data](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html) if it is important so as to prevent the loss. Here is how to do this to fix the crashing Phone app.

1. Open "Settings" and go to the "Backup and Reset" option.
2. Look for "Factory data reset" and then tap on "Reset phone".
3. Within a while, your device will go through resetting and boot up to normalcy.
