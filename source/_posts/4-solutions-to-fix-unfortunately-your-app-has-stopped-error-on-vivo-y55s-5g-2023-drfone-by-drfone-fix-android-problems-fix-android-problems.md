Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023), but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

2. Now take another Bluetooth device and connect this to the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device you’re trying to connect too. This could be another Android device, or even a computer or iOS device
3. If the new device doesn’t connect to your Bluetooth device, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Bluetooth device, not your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023)
4. If the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023)

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) to the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.

This should solve the problem. If not, move on to the other techniques.

#### **2.4 Check APK File**

An incomplete and irregular App installation may cause the .apk file to get corrupted. Make sure you download the file completely. If need be, delete the existing App or its .apk file and reinstall it from Google Play Store for it to be compatible with your device’s software and to use the App smoothly.

#### **2.5 Check App Manifest File**

Manifested App files are nothing but .apk files which are improvised by you. Such changes may cause the Parse Error to occur more frequently. Modifications in the App file can be made by changing its name, App settings, or more advanced customizations. Make sure you roll back all changes and restore the App file to its original state to prevent it from getting corrupted.

#### **2.6 Disable Antivirus and other cleaner Apps**

Antivirus software and other cleaning Apps are very helpful in blocking unwanted and harmful Apps from damaging your device. However, sometimes such Apps also prevent you from using other safe Apps.

We do not suggest that you delete the Antivirus App permanently. Temporary uninstallation will be useful here. To do so:

• Visit “Settings” and then select “Apps”.

• Select the antivirus App to click on “Uninstall” and then tap “OK”.

Now download and install the desired App again. Once this is done, do not forget to install the Antivirus App again.

#### **2.7 Clear Cache cookies of Play Store**
