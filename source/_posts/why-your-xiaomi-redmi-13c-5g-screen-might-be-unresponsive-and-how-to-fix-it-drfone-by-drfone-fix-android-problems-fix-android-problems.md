You’ve probably seen this error message before, especially when taking screenshots of banking or video streaming apps. But why do apps and websites block screenshots? It’s actually for your good.

Screenshots can be misused to steal money or pirate copyrighted content. By prohibiting screenshots, apps and websites can help to protect your data and privacy. If you want to learn more, keep reading. This article will explain why apps and websites prevent screenshot capture and why it’s important for security.

Prevent Fraud

Scammers and other criminals often use screenshots to commit fraud. For instance, people might send fake screenshots to trick others into sharing personal details or money. Disabling screenshots can help to prevent this type of fraud.
