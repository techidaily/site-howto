### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending.

### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your OnePlus Nord 3 5G in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.

### Update Gmail App
