Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Samsung Galaxy A25 5G touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Samsung Galaxy A25 5G phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen.

## **What causes a Samsung Galaxy A25 5G Screen to be unresponsive?**
