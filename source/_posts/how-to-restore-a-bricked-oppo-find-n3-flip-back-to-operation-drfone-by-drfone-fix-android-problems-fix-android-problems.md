## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Oppo Find N3 Flip device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device.
