## Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM

The easiest thing that you can try if your Infinix GT 10 Pro is not receiving any text messages is because the SIM is not inserted right. If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can't receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.

## Part 3: Check Network Connection

Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Infinix GT 10 Pro phone is to check your network connection. Usually, you can see the bar on the top of the screen. Maybe the problem exists because you have no signal strength at the moment.

![android not receiving texts - check connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/no-internet-connection.jpg)

## Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan

Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Infinix GT 10 Pros because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Infinix GT 10 Pro is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.

## Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot

Sometimes, people complain that Infinix GT 10 Pro is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.

When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.

## Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App

In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.

Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.

![android not receiving texts clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg)

Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Infinix GT 10 Pro device free up the memory of your device.

Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.

## Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space

Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Infinix GT 10 Pro, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.

Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.

![android not receiving texts - free up space](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg)

Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM. You can either delete all the messages or perform a selective deletion to free up space.

## Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App

If you can’t receive messages on your default app, then you can try installing a third-party messaging app. Nowadays, most people use social media messaging apps like WhatsApp, Skype, etc. for messaging. So, if somehow, the Android is not receiving texts, then the new apps can help you to send and receive messages with a non-native network.

## Part 9: Ensure your Phone is Fully Charged

Another possible fix to this problem might be your phone’s battery percentage. Sometimes, when the Android is in power saving mode, it disables the default apps too. As a result, you can't even receive text messages on Android. So, when you plug in the charger, the power saving mode will be disabled, and you will get your text messages.

## Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone

If the Infinix GT 10 Pro phone is not receiving texts from iPhone, then this might be a different issue. Usually, there is an option on the iPhone where they can send texts as iMessage and simple messages. If the iPhone user sends the text as iMessage, then it will not show up on the Android device. To resolve this, you have to follow the steps below:

Taking the iPhone in hand makes sure that you are connected to a network. Open settings and scroll to look for the Message option. Toggle the bar next to the iMessage option to turn it off.

![android not receiving texts - check iphone message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/deactivate-imessages.jpg)

If the FaceTime option is also on, you might have to deactivate that too to send messages and calls as regular ones.

## Part 11: [Update Your Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-update/samsung-update.html)

Updating the operating system to the latest Android version can fix some system errors which may cause the "Android not receiving texts" issue because the latest version always brings a better user experience and fix the know bugs.
