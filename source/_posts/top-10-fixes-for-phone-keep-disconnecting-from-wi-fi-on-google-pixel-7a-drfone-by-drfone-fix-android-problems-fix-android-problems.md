![fix wifi keep disconnecting android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/why-does-my-phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi.jpg)

Since everything revolves around the internet, it's annoying if your WI-FI disconnects. You might question yourself **why does my Wi-Fi keep disconnecting from the phone**? To know the answer, read the article below.

## Part 1: Why Does Your Phone Keep Disconnecting from WiFi?

Is your phone frequently getting disconnected from Wi-Fi? Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Google Pixel 7a devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:

- **Router Problems**

If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.

- **Out of Wi-Fi Range**

**Why does My Google Pixel 7a keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi**? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.

- **Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked**

The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.

- **Devices Connected with Router**

Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.

- **Unstable Internet**

If your Google Pixel 7a gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.

Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.

## Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone

As we have mentioned earlier if your Wi-Fi is stable, but it keeps disconnecting from [Google Pixel 7a S22](https://drfone.wondershare.com/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s22.html) or other Android phones, the coming section of this article is for you.

### Fix 1: Restart Your Phone

### Fix 2: Check Router Settings

If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings. This is because your phone might be blocked from connecting to the network, and if this is the scenario, your phone will never maintain the connection. You should check the Router’s admin panel or app to remove your phone from the blocklist.

![check router settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-2.jpg)

### Fix 3: Reconnect to Network

To fix the annoying problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting, you should try forgetting the network and then reconnecting to it. This could be done easily by following the steps below:

**Step 1**: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.

![tap on your wifi option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg)

### Fix 4: Restart Your Router

As we discussed, to restart your phone, you can also restart the router to get rid of the problem. For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start.

### Fix 5: Forget Old Networks

The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.

**Step 1**: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.

### Fix 6. Check Recently Installed Applications

Sometimes, different installed applications can also cause trouble. If your Wi-Fi was fine, but suddenly it started disconnecting, then don’t forget to check the recently installed apps.

### Fix 8: Check Routers Range

If your Wi-Fi automatically disconnects and connects again while you are roaming in the house, then it is because of the router's range; you should check it. For this, you can consider changing and modifying your AP (Access Point) band on your router.
