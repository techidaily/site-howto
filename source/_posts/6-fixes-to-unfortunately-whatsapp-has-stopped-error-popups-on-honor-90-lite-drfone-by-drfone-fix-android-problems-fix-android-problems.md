### Reason 2. Problematic App

**Solution:** While in Safe Mode, observe if the Honor 90 Lite device boots up properly. If it successfully boots, it suggests that a third-party application is causing the problem. To pinpoint the problematic app, uninstall recently added apps individually and restart the Honor 90 Lite device after each removal.
