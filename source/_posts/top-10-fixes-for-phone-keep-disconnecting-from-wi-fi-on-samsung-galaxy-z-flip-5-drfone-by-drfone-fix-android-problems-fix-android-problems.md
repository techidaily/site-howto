- **Router Problems**

If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.

- **Devices Connected with Router**

Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.

- **Unstable Internet**

If your Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.

Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.

### Fix 1: Restart Your Phone

If the Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting from your Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, but the internet is stable, then you should try to fix the issue by restarting your phone. Sometimes, it's the phone that’s causing a problem, so to resolve it, you can follow the steps given below:

![select reboot option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-1.jpg)

### Fix 2: Check Router Settings

If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings.

You should check the Router’s admin panel or app to remove your phone from the blocklist.

![check router settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-2.jpg)

### Fix 3: Reconnect to Network

To fix the annoying problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting, you should try forgetting the network and then reconnecting to it. This could be done easily by following the steps below:

**Step 1**: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.

![tap on your wifi option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg)

**Step 2**: A list of all the Wi-Fi networks will appear on the screen. Select the network that is causing trouble from that list and hit the 'Forget Network' option.

![enter wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-5.jpg)

### Fix 4: Restart Your Router

### Fix 5: Forget Old Networks

The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.

**Step 1**: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.

### Fix 8: Check Routers Range

If your Wi-Fi automatically disconnects and connects again while you are roaming in the house, then it is because of the router's range; you should check it. For this, you can consider changing and modifying your AP (Access Point) band on your router.
