Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.

### Reset Device to Factory Settings

****Step 1:**** Since your touch screen is not working, you can factory reset it using Google’s Find My Device web service.
