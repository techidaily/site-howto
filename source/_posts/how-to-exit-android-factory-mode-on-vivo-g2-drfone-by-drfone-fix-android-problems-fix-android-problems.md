1. For any Android devices, remove the battery (considering the battery of your Vivo G2 can be removed) and leave it out for at least 30 minutes. Put back the battery in and try to turn it on.
2. Press and hold down the **Power** and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time for 15-30 minutes to reboot the Vivo G2 device.

4. If there are any connected hardware e.g. SD card, remove them from the Vivo G2 device.
5. Start your Vivo G2 in **Safe Mode** by pressing and holding down the **Menu** or **Volume Down** button on your device.
6. Should the first five steps do not work for you, perform a hard reset. Do take note that each device will have a different way to do so and that data that is stored locally on the phone will be deleted.
7. Send your Vivo G2 to the repair shop should none of these steps work.
