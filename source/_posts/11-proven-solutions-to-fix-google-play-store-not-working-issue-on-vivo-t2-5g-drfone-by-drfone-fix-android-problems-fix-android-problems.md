## Fixes for Apps Keep Crashing on Vivo T2 5G

The rapid evolution of technology has transformed our smartphones into powerful devices. Presently, with just a few taps, they possess the ability to accomplish a diverse array of tasks. It has been possible due to the extensive availability of mobile applications. However, it can be incredibly frustrating when your favorite apps keep crashing repeatedly.

You're not alone if you're an Android user who encounters app crashes. This article will explore ten practical ways to fix apps that keep crashing on Android devices. We will also discuss the causes behind app crashes and how to prevent them.

## Part 1: What Are the Causes Behind Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

There are many reasons for ****the app crashing**** on Android devices. These reasons range from insufficient storage space to bugs and glitches in the apps. Finding out the root cause of an app crashing is important so that you can find the appropriate solution. Discussed below are some of the reasons why your Android apps keep crashing:

### Insufficient Memory

When a device is low on memory, it may struggle to run multiple apps simultaneously. Each app requires memory to store its data and execute its processes. If the available memory is limited, it can cause apps to crash. That happens because they don't have enough resources to operate properly.

### Software Compatibility

Android devices come in various models and run different operating system versions. That's why it is essential to use apps compatible with your device. Since there are a lot of Android variants, it is hard to optimize apps for all devices. An app not optimized for an Android version or device leads to crashes or malfunctions.

### Outdated Apps

Apps are regularly updated to introduce new features, fix bugs, and enhance performance. Using an outdated version of an app may cause instability or compatibility problems. Since the app is not optimized for the current version of Android, it can keep crashing.

### Network Problems

Some apps rely heavily on network connectivity to function properly. They need a stable and strong internet connection to perform all the functions. These apps can crash if there are network connectivity issues, such as a weak Wi-Fi or network outage. Unstable connections can disrupt data transmission, making the app's function challenging.

### App Bugs

Despite rigorous testing, apps can still have bugs or coding errors that lead to crashes. Bugs in apps can occur due to various reasons. It mostly relates to incorrect implementation of features or unexpected user interactions. App developers work to identify and fix these bugs, often releasing updates.

## Part 2: How to Fix the Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

Once you discover why your Android apps keep crashing, fixing them becomes a lot easier. However, there is no need to worry even if you cannot locate the problem source. Below we have listed 10 general and specialized solutions to ****fix app crashing****:

### Fix 1: Check the Internet Connection

As mentioned before, some apps rely on the internet to function. If you don’t have an active internet connection, they will not work. To avoid ****the app crashing****, you need to ensure that the internet connection on your device is working. If you use Wi-Fi, check the router and turn Wi-Fi off and on again. In the case of mobile data, try enabling Airplane mode and then disabling it.

![check the internet connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/apps-keeps-crashing-android-1.jpg)

### Fix 2: Force Stop the Apps Keep Crashing

If your ****apps keep crashing****, you should try force-closing the targeted app and re-opening it. Doing this will flush out minor bugs and glitches from the app. These temporary bugs and glitches can occur due to various reasons and hamper the app's working. Use the following steps to force stop the app that keeps crashing and re-open it:

- ****Step 1:**** On your Vivo T2 5G, move the app icon and press it to select “App Info.” On the App Info screen, tap the “Force Stop” button to force close the app. The button can be either on the down left or down right corner.
