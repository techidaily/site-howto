Whether you are dealing with a single stuck pixel or a cluster of dead pixels, this section aims to provide you with helpful insights.

### 1\. Can Dead Vivo X90Ss Fix Themselves?

No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Vivo X90Ss Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

### 3\. Why Are Dead Vivo X90Ss Spreading on My Vivo X90S?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Vivo X90Ss Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Vivo X90S devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.

## Conclusion

With this knowledge, you can apply the different tools and techniques for removing ****stuck pixels on phone**** screens and how to work around dead pixels on the phone screen. Whether using software like Dr.Fone or employing manual methods such as rebooting or cleaning your device, there are various options you can try.
