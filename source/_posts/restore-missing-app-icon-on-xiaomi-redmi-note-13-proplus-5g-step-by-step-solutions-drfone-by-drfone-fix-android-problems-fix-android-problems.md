Now, see whether you can find the **app icon that disappeared on your Android.** If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.

## Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android

_“_**_All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen._** _What should I do?”_

If you've confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don't fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the **missing app icon on Android**.

### 1\. Check hidden apps

How could the **Android phone icon be missing**? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.

However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:

- **Step 1.** Go to your phone’s Settings.
- **Step 2.** Use the search bar to look for "Hidden app."

### 2\. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer

If your **app icon disappeared on your Android**, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:

- **Step 1.** Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.

### 3\. Re-enable disabled app

**App icons can also disappear on the Android** home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as 'Freezer,' allowing users to temporarily halt the apps.

To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:

- **Step 1**. Open the Apps & Notifications on the Settings.
- **Step 2.** Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the **phone icon disappears on your Android.**
- **Step 3:** In the App Info, tap Enable.

### 4\. Reset Android to factory settings

But before doing that, it's important to back up your data first because a factory reset will clear all your data and cache when you press the reset button.

- **Step 1:** Go to your Android Settings.
- **Step 2:** Select Backup and Reset > Factory data reset. Then, choose to erase all data.
