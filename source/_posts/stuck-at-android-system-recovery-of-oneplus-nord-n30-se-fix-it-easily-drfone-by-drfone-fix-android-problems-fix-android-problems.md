This can happen to various models, such as the OnePlus Nord N30 SE, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an OnePlus Nord N30 SE device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the OnePlus Nord N30 SE F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Protecting the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
