Encountering the frustrating "**your device isn’t compatible with this version Google Play**" error can be disruptive. That's why it is essential to go through the underlying reasons causing this compatibility issue:

### 1\. Outdated Operating System Firmware

One of the primary culprits behind the compatibility error is [<u>outdated OS firmware</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html). App developers release updates to keep up with the latest features and security patches. That's why an obsolete OS version on your device may render it incompatible with the newer app versions available on the Google Play Store.

### 2\. Insufficient Hardware Requirements

Each application has specific hardware prerequisites that your device needs to fulfill. In case your smartphone does not meet the required specifications, you won't be able to utilize the app. Thus, Google Play Store may restrict access to certain applications, citing compatibility issues.

Cache files are designed to enhance the speed and efficiency of app loading. Yet, they can sometimes become corrupt. When this occurs, it disrupts the app's normal operation. Clearing these corrupted cache files is often a crucial step.

### 4\. Beta Versions and Unstable Releases

Engaging with beta versions or unstable releases of an app can result in compatibility issues. These versions are typically in the testing phase.

Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Realme C51 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Realme C51, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Realme C51 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Realme C51 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Realme C51 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Realme C51 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Realme C51 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Realme C51 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
