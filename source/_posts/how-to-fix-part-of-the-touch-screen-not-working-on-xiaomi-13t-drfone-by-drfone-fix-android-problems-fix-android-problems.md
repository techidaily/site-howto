- The touch screen incorrectly responds to your touch.
- ****Half touch screen is not working****.
- The touch screen becomes frozen or hangs.
- The screen flashes, flickers, or remains blank.
- The****left side of the phone screen is not working****.

Before proceeding to how to fix an unresponsive touch screen on an Android device, you should complete the following steps:

- Before continuing, make sure your screen is spotless.

## Part 3. How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working (No Physical Damage)

If you have already tried running the Xiaomi 13T device in diagnostic mode and verified that it is not physically damaged, then the problem is most likely technical. If your Xiaomi 13T’s screen is not responding to touches for technical reasons, follow the methods below to resolve the issue.

### Restart Your Device

When your touch screen stops working, the first thing you should do is restart your device. The operation is known as soft resetting. You cannot turn your device off from the option on the screen because the touch screen is not responding. Here are the steps to take.

****Step 1:**** Hold the “Power” button until the Xiaomi 13T device turns off.

**Tip:** If you hold down the power button for a few seconds, you will see the “Power Off” and “Restart” options on the screen. You can’t use it because the entire screen isn’t responding. Hence, you should press and hold the “Power” button for as long as necessary.

![restart android with power button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-1.JPG)

****Step 2:**** When the Xiaomi 13T device turns off, wait a few seconds.

****Step 3:**** Press and hold the “Power” button to restart the Xiaomi 13T device.

Check to see if the Android auto touch screen is not working problem has been resolved. Otherwise, proceed with the following methods.

### Turn On Safe Mode

You should switch to Safe mode whenever an application or piece of software causes a problem on your device. Only the most fundamental system components are loaded and used when operating in Safe mode.

If your touch screen is functional in safe mode, the issue is most likely internal. You can quickly fix the Android touchscreen issue by following the prompts given below to activate the safe mode:

****Step 1:**** To force a restart, press and hold the Xiaomi 13T device’s “Power” button for an extended period.

****Step 2:**** Maintain pressure on the “Power” button. Take your finger off it once you see the manufacturer’s logo.

### Turn Off Developer Options

Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.

If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:

****Step 1:**** Launch the ****Settings**** app on your device.

****Step 2:**** Select the ****System**** menu item, which usually locates at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3:** Tap the Advanced options menu, then select Developer Options.

### Reset Device to Factory Settings

Resetting your device to its factory settings will return it to its state when you first unboxed it. All your phone’s data and installed apps will be erased, including any malware on your device that may be causing the issue to occur. Here’s how to restore your device to factory settings:

****Step 1:**** Since your touch screen is not working, you can factory reset it using Google’s Find My Device web service.
