Below are some possible causes of Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot.

These issues can also occur in any Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector.

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G black screen problem.
