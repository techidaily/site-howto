If you have already tried running the Honor 90 device in diagnostic mode and verified that it is not physically damaged, then the problem is most likely technical. If your Honor 90’s screen is not responding to touches for technical reasons, follow the methods below to resolve the issue.

### Restart Your Device

When your touch screen stops working, the first thing you should do is restart your device. The operation is known as soft resetting. You cannot turn your device off from the option on the screen because the touch screen is not responding. Here are the steps to take.

****Step 1:**** Hold the “Power” button until the Honor 90 device turns off.

**Tip:** If you hold down the power button for a few seconds, you will see the “Power Off” and “Restart” options on the screen. You can’t use it because the entire screen isn’t responding. Hence, you should press and hold the “Power” button for as long as necessary.

![restart android with power button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-1.JPG)

****Step 2:**** When the Honor 90 device turns off, wait a few seconds.

****Step 3:**** Press and hold the “Power” button to restart the Honor 90 device.

Check to see if the Android auto touch screen is not working problem has been resolved. Otherwise, proceed with the following methods.

### Turn On Safe Mode

You should switch to Safe mode whenever an application or piece of software causes a problem on your device. Only the most fundamental system components are loaded and used when operating in Safe mode.

If your touch screen is functional in safe mode, the issue is most likely internal. You can quickly fix the Android touchscreen issue by following the prompts given below to activate the safe mode:

****Step 1:**** To force a restart, press and hold the Honor 90 device’s “Power” button for an extended period.

****Step 2:**** Maintain pressure on the “Power” button. Take your finger off it once you see the manufacturer’s logo.

### Turn Off Developer Options

Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.

If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:

****Step 1:**** Launch the ****Settings**** app on your device.

## Part 3: 10 Common Fixes When Google Play Services Won’t Update

### Method 1. Restart your Android and try to update again

In most cases, restarting the Honor 90 device can simply do the trick. When you restart the Honor 90 device, most of the issues get eliminated making the Honor 90 device perform better than before. Also, it is all about RAM. While you restart your device, the RAM gets cleared. As a result, the apps work properly. So, in the first place, we would like you to restart your Honor 90 when you cannot update Google Play Services. Once restarted, try to update again and see if the results are positive.

### Method 2. Uninstall Google Play Services Updates and Reattempt the Update

Uninstalling previous Google Play Services updates resolves conflicts and errors, often addressing the issue of updates. This process clears potential obstacles, enabling a successful update of Google Play Services. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your device's "Settings."
2. Scroll down and select "Apps" or "App Manager."
3. Locate and tap on "Google Play Services."
4. Depending on your device and Android version, you might need to tap on "App info" or "Storage."
5. Look for the option to "Uninstall updates." This will revert Google Play Services to its original version.
6. Confirm the action when prompted.
7. Once the updates are uninstalled, go back to the Google Play Store.
8. Search for "Google Play Services" using the search bar at the top.
9. If an update is available, you'll see the option to "Update." Tap on it to start the update process.
10. After the update is complete, restart your device to ensure the changes take effect.

### Method 3. Update Google Play Store

Ensure that you have the latest version of the Google Play Store app installed on your device. Open the Play Store, go to Settings, and check for updates. Updating the Play Store can often resolve compatibility issues with Google Play Services updates.

### Method 4. Google account and re-add it

Go to your device's Settings, select Accounts or Users, and remove your Google account. Restart your device and add the account again. This process can refresh the connection and resolve update issues.

### Method 5. Uninstall unnecessary apps

As we mentioned above, due to a lot of apps being installed at the same time, the issue can crop up. And hence, if the above solution didn’t help, you can try to uninstall the apps that you don’t need currently. We hope this works. But if not, you can go to the next fix.

### Method 6. Clear Google Play Services cache

If still you cannot update Google Play Services, clearing cache can solve your problem. We also stated this in the beginning as the reason. If you don’t know, cache holds the app’s data temporarily so that it can remember the information when you next open the app. Many times, old cache files get corrupted. And clearing cache can also help in saving storage space on your device. For these reasons, you need to clear cache of Google Play Services to get rid of the problem.

Here is how to clear Google Play Services cache:

![set correct date and time](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/clear-cache.jpg)

- Launch “Settings” on your phone and go to “Apps & Notifications” or “Application” or “Application Manager”.
- Now, from all the apps’ list, choose “Google Play Services”.
- On opening it, tap “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.
