## Part 1. Preliminary Reasons For Cellular Network Not Available For Voice Calls

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

### 3\. Network Congestion

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the Itel P40+ device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.

### 5\. Battery or Power Issues

In some instances, [<u>insufficient battery power</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-your-phone-battery-health.html) or power-saving modes on devices can cause this issue.

Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Itel P40+ device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Itel P40+, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Itel P40+ device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Itel P40+ F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Itel P40+ device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Itel P40+ Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Itel P40+ device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Itel P40+ device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
