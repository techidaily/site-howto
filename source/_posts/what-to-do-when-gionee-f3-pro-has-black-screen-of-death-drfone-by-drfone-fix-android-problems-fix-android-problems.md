![turn on airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android-1.jpg)

## Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings

The third step you’ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Gionee F3 Pro. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.

However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.

1. Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights
2. While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem
3. Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again
4. Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area
5. Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Gionee F3 Pro is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data

## Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode

![wifi not working on android - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg)

If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Gionee F3 Pro itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.

The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Gionee F3 Pro, but the basic process goes as follows;

1. Turn off your Gionee F3 Pro by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Gionee F3 Pro device is completely off
2. Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time
3. You will see the words ‘Safe Mode’ appear on your screen as the Gionee F3 Pro device loads
4. Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works

If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, you’ll know you have a problem with an app or service that’s running on your device. If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.

## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

If you’re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, you’ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Gionee F3 Pro itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.

You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.

1. If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Gionee F3 Pro device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection
2. If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Gionee F3 Pro is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there
3. Whichever method you’re using, try disconnecting your Gionee F3 Pro and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Gionee F3 Pro needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Gionee F3 Pro. Here’s how to check on your Gionee F3 Pro to make sure everything is correct.

1. Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Gionee F3 Pro
2. Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router
3. Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router
4. Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches

When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.

## Part 7. Fix Android system issues in one click

If none of the solutions above are working, this could indicate a real problem with the firmware and operating system of your Gionee F3 Pro. Fortunately, a fast solution to get everything working again is to completely repair the software of your phone.

![android phone not connecting to wifi - connectivity on another phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

When experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, it’s worth noting the problem might not be with your phone, but rather the Wi-Fi network itself. This is why it’s important to make sure you check the connection on another device.

Just like the method above where you’ll be effectively resetting the network settings on your router, if this hasn’t worked, you’ll be able to reset the network settings on your Gionee F3 Pro, hopefully removing the bugs and allowing you to connect.

Here’s how you can do this easily on your Gionee F3 Pro;

1. From the home screen of your Gionee F3 Pro, open the Settings menu
2. Tap the Backup & Reset option
3. Tap the Reset Network Settings option
4. Tap the Reset Network option
5. If you need to, enter the PIN number or passcode for the Android device, and the Gionee F3 Pro device will confirm the reset has taken place
6. Reconnect your Gionee F3 Pro to your Wi-Fi network for the changes to take effect

## Part 11. Clear partition cache in recovery mode

![wifi not working on android - clear partition](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-partitioncache.jpg)

As you continue to use your Gionee F3 Pro, the partition cache will fill up with data your device needs and doesn’t need. However, by clearing your device’s partition cache, you can make clear up some space which should help your device have enough memory to connect to the internet.

1. Turn off your Gionee F3 Pro
2. Turn it on by holding down the power button, volume button, and home button
3. When your phone vibrates, let go of the Power button, but continue to hold the volume button
4. When a menu is displayed, use the volume buttons to navigate the menu
5. Select the Android System Recovery option, followed by Wipe Cache Partition
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet

## Part 12. Reset factory settings

If worse comes to worst, another option you have is to factory reset your Gionee F3 Pro. As we’ve spoken about above, while using your phone from the day you started using it, your device will fill up with files and data which can become messy and causes bugs.

However, by factory resetting your device, you can start again from the factory default from which you first received it, ultimately clearing the bugs. Make sure you back up your device before proceeding because it will erase your personal files.

1. Open the Settings menu on your Gionee F3 Pro
2. Navigate to System > Advanced > Reset Options
3. Tap the Reset phone option, and enter your PIN code if required
4. Tap Erase Everything
5. Wait for your phone to complete the process
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet

## Why Is My Gionee F3 Pro Offline? Troubleshooting Guide

Ever had your Gionee F3 Pro claim it's offline, leaving you scratching your head about where it went wrong? We get it; it's confusing. That's why this article is here to untangle the mystery.

In the following sections, we're diving into the **"why is My Gionee F3 Pro offline"** dilemma that many Android users face. We'll break down the possible reasons behind this common issue and guide you through simple steps on how to fix it. By the end of the article, you’ll be able to get back to smooth internet surfing on your Gionee F3 Pro. Let’s get started.

## Part 1: Why Does My Gionee F3 Pro Say Offline?

When you encounter the “offline” error message, it can disrupt your usual smartphone activities. Suddenly, you find yourself unable to browse the internet, send or receive emails, or stay connected through instant messages.

It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Gionee F3 Pro showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Gionee F3 Pro. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

2. **Internet connection issues**

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My Gionee F3 Pro offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.

3. **Glitches or bugs**

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Gionee F3 Pro can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

4. **Firewall restrictions**

In some cases, a firewall on your Gionee F3 Pro might be overly restrictive, preventing the Gionee F3 Pro device from establishing a connection to the internet. This security measure, intended to protect your device, can sometimes go overboard and disrupt normal online functionality.

Now, you have understood the potential causes as the first step toward resolving the issue. Next, we'll guide you through the process of troubleshooting and getting your Gionee F3 Pro back online.
