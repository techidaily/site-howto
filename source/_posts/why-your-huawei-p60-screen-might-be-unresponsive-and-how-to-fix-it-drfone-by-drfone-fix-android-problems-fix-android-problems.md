## Common Causes of Huawei P60 Screen Unresponsiveness

While Huawei P60 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Huawei P60 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Huawei P60, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Huawei P60 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Huawei P60 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Huawei P60 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Huawei P60 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Huawei P60 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Huawei P60 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Huawei P60 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Huawei P60 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent Huawei P60 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Huawei P60 device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid Huawei P60 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Huawei P60 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Huawei P60 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Huawei P60 App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Huawei P60 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data.
