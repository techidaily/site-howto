This is why it can so annoying when it gets to a point where the internet connection isn’t working. However, the problem of a web page not loading correctly is just the tip of the iceberg.

There are plenty of problems you could experience, whether it’s the [Wi-Fi network keeps disconnecting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/why-does-my-phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi.html) on its own without any warning, perhaps a security issue where the passcode or IP address isn’t being registered properly, or even if the connection is just being super slow, even if there’s no reason too.

Luckily, despite there being so many problems out there, there are also many solutions. Today, we’re going to share with you the complete definitive guide to help you get your Vivo V30 Lite 5G connected and free from problems and issues.

## Part 1: Restart your Vivo V30 Lite 5G

![turn on airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android-1.jpg)

## Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings

The third step you’ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Vivo V30 Lite 5G. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.

However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.

1. Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights
2. While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem
3. Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again
4. Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area
5. Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Vivo V30 Lite 5G is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data

## Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode

![wifi not working on android - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg)

If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Vivo V30 Lite 5G itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.

The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Vivo V30 Lite 5G, but the basic process goes as follows;

1. Turn off your Vivo V30 Lite 5G by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device is completely off
2. Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time
3. You will see the words ‘Safe Mode’ appear on your screen as the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device loads
4. Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works

If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, you’ll know you have a problem with an app or service that’s running on your device. If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.

## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

If you’re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, you’ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Vivo V30 Lite 5G itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.

You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.

1. If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection
2. If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Vivo V30 Lite 5G is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there
3. Whichever method you’re using, try disconnecting your Vivo V30 Lite 5G and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Vivo V30 Lite 5G needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Vivo V30 Lite 5G. Here’s how to check on your Vivo V30 Lite 5G to make sure everything is correct.

1. Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Vivo V30 Lite 5G
2. Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router
3. Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router
4. Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches

When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.

## Part 7. Fix Android system issues in one click

If none of the solutions above are working, this could indicate a real problem with the firmware and operating system of your Vivo V30 Lite 5G. Fortunately, a fast solution to get everything working again is to completely repair the software of your phone.

## Part 8. Check the Wi-Fi connectivity on another phone

![android phone not connecting to wifi - connectivity on another phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

When experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, it’s worth noting the problem might not be with your phone, but rather the Wi-Fi network itself. This is why it’s important to make sure you check the connection on another device.

Of course, if you’re already using another phone on your Wi-Fi network, you know this isn’t the case. However, if you’re not sure, here’s what you need to do;

1. Get another Android or iOS phone or tablet
2. Open the Settings menu and connect to the Wi-Fi network you’re having problems with
3. Enter the password and connect to the network
4. Open a web browser on the phone and try loading a web page
5. If the page loads, you know the Wi-Fi network isn’t the problem

## Part 9. Change the password of the Wi-Fi

![android phone not connecting to wifi - password settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-password.jpg)

Each Wi-Fi network router will give the opportunity to choose and change the password you have to let devices connect to your network. It’s important you try changing this because you never know if someone else has accessed your network and could be blocking your device. Here’s how it works;

1. Log onto your computer and open your Wi-Fi settings
2. Depending on the brand and method of your individual router, navigate to the Wi-Fi password settings menu
3. Change the password to something complicated using all available digits and characters
4. Save the password and restart the router to disconnect all devices
5. Now connect your Vivo V30 Lite 5G to the router using the new password

## Part 10. Reset network settings on Android

![android phone not connecting to wifi - reset network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-network.jpg)

Just like the method above where you’ll be effectively resetting the network settings on your router, if this hasn’t worked, you’ll be able to reset the network settings on your Vivo V30 Lite 5G, hopefully removing the bugs and allowing you to connect.

Here’s how you can do this easily on your Vivo V30 Lite 5G;

1. From the home screen of your Vivo V30 Lite 5G, open the Settings menu
2. Tap the Backup & Reset option
3. Tap the Reset Network Settings option
4. Tap the Reset Network option
5. If you need to, enter the PIN number or passcode for the Android device, and the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device will confirm the reset has taken place

If worse comes to worst, another option you have is to factory reset your Vivo V30 Lite 5G. As we’ve spoken about above, while using your phone from the day you started using it, your device will fill up with files and data which can become messy and causes bugs.
