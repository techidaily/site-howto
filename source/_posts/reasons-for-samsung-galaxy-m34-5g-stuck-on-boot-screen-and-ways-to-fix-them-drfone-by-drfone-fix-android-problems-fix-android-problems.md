There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your ****Android boot screen**** happens and some tips to overcome it.

### 1. Changes to the Software

Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the ****Android boot screen****.

Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.

Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an ****Android phone stuck on the logo**** page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.

### 2. Android Software Updates

Updates are a common cause of ****Android phones stuck on the logo****. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen**** and many others might occur.

Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.

When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your ****Android phone getting stuck on the logo****.

### 3. Malfunctioning Applications

If you noticed that your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.

This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G functioning properly.

## Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings

The third step you’ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.

However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.

1. Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights
2. While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem
3. Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again
4. Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area
5. Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data

## Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode

![wifi not working on android - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg)

If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.

If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.

## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

If you’re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, you’ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.

You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.

2. If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there
3. Whichever method you’re using, try disconnecting your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G. Here’s how to check on your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G to make sure everything is correct.

When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.

## Part 7. Fix Android system issues in one click

![android phone not connecting to wifi - connectivity on another phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

When experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, it’s worth noting the problem might not be with your phone, but rather the Wi-Fi network itself. This is why it’s important to make sure you check the connection on another device.

Of course, if you’re already using another phone on your Wi-Fi network, you know this isn’t the case. However, if you’re not sure, here’s what you need to do;

3. Change the password to something complicated using all available digits and characters
