## Vivo G2 Screen Unresponsive? Here's How to Fix It

Vivo G2 phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Vivo G2 touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Vivo G2 phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Vivo G2 touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Vivo G2 Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Vivo G2 phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Vivo G2 screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Vivo G2 Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Vivo G2 device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Vivo G2 screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Vivo G2 model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Vivo G2 Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Vivo G2 Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Vivo G2 screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Vivo G2 model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Vivo G2 black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Vivo G2's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Vivo G2 device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Vivo G2 device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Vivo G2logo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Vivo G2 device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Vivo G2 device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Vivo G2 device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service
