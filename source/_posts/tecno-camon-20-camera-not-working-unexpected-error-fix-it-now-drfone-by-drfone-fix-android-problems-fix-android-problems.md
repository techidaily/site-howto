![camera not working error in android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg)

## Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?

There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Tecno Camon 20.

**Low Memory**

Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.

**Low Storage**

The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.

**General Bugs And Glitches**

OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.

**Hardware Issues**

In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Tecno Camon 20. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.

## Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?

So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Tecno Camon 20 right where you are, without needing to take the Tecno Camon 20 device to the manufacturer’s service center.

### II.I: Restart The Handset

One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Tecno Camon 20 device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.

![restarting android handset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg)

Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.

### II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App

If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.

Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.

![closing apps in app switcher](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg)

Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.

### II.III: Check App Permissions

These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera > Permissions.

![camera permissions check android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Camera.

![set camera permissions android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg)

Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.

### II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache

Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera and tap Storage Usage.

![clear camera app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

![clear camera app cache android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg)

### II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache

The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Photos > Storage Usage.

![clear photo gallery app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

### II.VI: Check For App Updates

This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.

Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.

![google play store app updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.

![check for app updates play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg)

Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.

### II.VII: Cool The Phone Down

We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.

If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.

### II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System

You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.

### II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)

Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre. And, we have just the app to help you fix your camera not working on Android problem quickly.

In everyday settings, our mobile devices have become our greatest friends, therefore breaking your phone is the last thing you want to do. There are different reasons why devices brick, and we must be familiar with them in order to comprehend the various techniques to repair bricked devices.

Here are some common reasons why your Tecno Camon 20 is bricked:

- **Flashing Stock/Custom ROM:**It is possible that you installed an incompatible ROM in the Android phone, that the phone shuts off during the process, or that you have performed other errors that cause your phone to restart indefinitely or to become stuck at the starting screen.
- **Rooting an Android device:**You are unable to effectively root the Tecno Camon 20 device.
- **Android firmware is being updated:**If the phone is interrupted when updating the Android firmware, it will be bricked.
- **Installing harmful applications:**You installed harmful programs on your Tecno Camon 20, or the phone was infected with a virus.

## Part 2. How to Fix a Bricked Phone

To repair bricked Android phones and tablets, you must first thoroughly examine the Tecno Camon 20 device's state.

Here are some simple methods for repairing bricked Android devices:

### Method 1. Reboot the Phone in Safe Mode

Trying to reboot your android device in safe mode is the first and easiest thing you should try if your phone is bricked. Here's how to do it:

- **Step 1:** Turn off your smartphone and press the **Volume Up** + **Power** button to enter recovery mode. Then, using the volume controls, navigate the menu and select Reboot system now.

![android safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/Bricked-Android-Phone-1.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Select the highlighted option by pressing the **Power button**. After that, wait for your device to reset normally.
- **Note:** The steps for booting into recovery mode may change based on the manufacturer of your device. For further information, go to the user manual for your phone or tablet.

### Method 2. Wipe the Cache Partition

This is the first indication that a user's phone has gone bricked. The phone turned on automatically, however it became stuck or frozen on the logo screen. The issue might be caused by the undeleting of data and cache, which prevents the phone from displaying the home screen.

This issue, however, may be resolved by wiping the data and cache partitions in recovery mode. You must do the following to do this:

- **Step 1:** Turn off your smartphone and enter recovery mode by pressing the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously. Different devices have various approaches for entering recovery mode, so you may perform better.

- **Step 3:** Finally, on your smartphone, choose the Reboot system immediately.

### Method 3. Perform a Factory Reset

A factory reset can undo the alterations made to your device that resulted in the brick phone, but you will lose everything you have downloaded and installed in the process. Here's how to restore a bricked Android phone to factory settings:

- **Step 1:** Boot your device into recovery mode (turn off your device, then press **power** button + **volume up** button).
- **Step 2:** Select “**Wipe Data/“Factory Reset”** then confirm the action. When the process is done, you'll be returned to the recovery mode menu.

- **Step 2:** Click the **“Install zip from sdcard”** button. Then, select the ZIP file that contains the ROM. Finally, click the **"reboot system now"** button.

- **Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.

When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.
