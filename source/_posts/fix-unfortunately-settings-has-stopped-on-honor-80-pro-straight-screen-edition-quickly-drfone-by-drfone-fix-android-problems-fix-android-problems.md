Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the ****Android boot screen****.

Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.

Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an ****Android phone stuck on the logo**** page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.

Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update.
