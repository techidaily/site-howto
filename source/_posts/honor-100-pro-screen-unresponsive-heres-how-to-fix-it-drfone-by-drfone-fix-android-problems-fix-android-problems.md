We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem.

## What Causes A Honor 100 Pro Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Honor 100 Pro phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Honor 100 Pro screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Honor 100 Pro Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Honor 100 Pro device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Honor 100 Pro screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Honor 100 Pro model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Honor 100 Pro Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Honor 100 Pro Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Honor 100 Pro screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Honor 100 Pro black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

To restart a Honor 100 Pro device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Honor 100 Prologo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

Leaving the Honor 100 Pro device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Honor 100 Pro device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service
