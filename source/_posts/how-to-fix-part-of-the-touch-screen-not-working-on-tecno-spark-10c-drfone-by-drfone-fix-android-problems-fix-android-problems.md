### Turn Off Developer Options

Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.

If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:

## Reliable User Guide to Fix Tecno Spark 10C Running Slow and Freezing

Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.

However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the **Android phone is running slow and freezing** over time. There can be many potential reasons why **Android phone runs slow** suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.

In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Tecno Spark 10C device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Tecno Spark 10C device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Tecno Spark 10C device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Tecno Spark 10C contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Tecno Spark 10C device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Tecno Spark 10C device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Tecno Spark 10C is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Tecno Spark 10C is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Tecno Spark 10Cs.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Tecno Spark 10C is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Tecno Spark 10C device. So if your Tecno Spark 10C is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Tecno Spark 10C device’s animation type and speed on your Tecno Spark 10C via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Tecno Spark 10C to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Tecno Spark 10C is running slow and freezing, the Tecno Spark 10C device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues

Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Tecno Spark 10C device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Tecno Spark 10C is running slow and freezing.

### Your Internet Connection is Unstable

Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too. Most apps today rely heavily on the internet to execute some tasks like communicating and streaming. So don’t panic when your Tecno Spark 10C is running slow and freezing. It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.

## What to Do When My Tecno Spark 10C Lags?

It’s not as bad as the black screen of death when the Android phone runs slow. However, it can still cause some delays and inconvenience for users.

## Authentication Error Occurred on Tecno Spark 10C? Here Are 10 Proven Fixes

There are times when users get an authentication error while they connect to a Wifi network. The problem is mostly found in Android whenever a device tries to establish a connection to Wifi. If your device is also experiencing an authentication problem Wifi, then don’t worry. It can easily be resolved. In this post, we will make you familiar with the root cause for the Tecno Spark 10C Wifi problem and how you can resolve whenever authentication error occurred on your device.

## Part 1: Any idea about the Wi-Fi authentication problem?

Wi-Fi authentication has to be done every time you wish to connect to a Wi-Fi network over your smartphone or laptop. To authenticate yourself and connect to the protected Wi-Fi network, you need to have the password of it. But if after you’re putting in the correct password and still experiencing the wifi authentication problem. Here’s what you need to know.

Authentication error occurs when the “deal” between the Wi-Fi router and device fails due to certain reasons. First, the Tecno Spark 10C device sends the password of the network and the "connect" request in an encrypted format to the Wi-Fi router. Then, the router decrypts the password and compares the password saved on it. Now, if the password matches, it sends affirmation for the "connect" request, and then the Tecno Spark 10C device is allowed to connect to the network.

## Part 2: Why Authentication Error Occurred when Connecting to Wifi?

There could be plenty of reasons for facing an authentication error on your device. Most of the time, it occurs whenever a Wifi router seems to malfunction. Furthermore, if your phone has been recently updated, then chances are that there could be an issue with its drivers. A security attack can also make your device malfunction as well.
