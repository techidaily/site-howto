## Part 1: Why Did My Itel P55+ Screen Go Black but Still Works? Common Causes

Experiencing a **cell phone blank screen** is not exclusive to Android or iOS users. A **phone screen not turning on** happens all the time due to several factors that may or may not be out of your control. While they can be frustrating, here are some common causes you should know as to why **your phone screen went black but still works.**

### A Drained Battery

The first thing that comes to mind when your **phone screen suddenly goes black** is you have a drained battery.

If your **phone is working, but the screen is black,** there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application. An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.

### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software.

This can also cause a **black screen but your phone is still on.**
