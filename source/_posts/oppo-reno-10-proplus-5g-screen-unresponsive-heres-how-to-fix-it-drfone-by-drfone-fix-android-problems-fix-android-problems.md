So, if your **Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G screens to become unresponsive.

These issues can also occur in any Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.
