## How to Quickly Fix Bluetooth Not Working on Itel P55

One of the key features of an Android device these days is the Bluetooth technology. This is such an important part of the phone that many of us take for granted, but as soon as the feature stops working, it can cause all kinds of problems.

When the repair process has been completed, you’ll receive the screen below, which means you can try again if the process didn’t work, or you can disconnect your Itel P55 and start using it and your Bluetooth features.

### 2.2 Restart Android and turn on Bluetooth again

![bluetooth not working on android - restart android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/restart-Bluetooth-Android.jpg)

One of the most common solutions in technology is simply to turn it on and off again, which is the case to happen here. By restarting your device, you can clear out any problems you may be suffering from to help it get up and running again. Here’s how;

1. Turn your Itel P55 off by holding down the Power button
2. Wait for several minutes and then turn your phone on again
3. Wait for your phone to completely power up, so you’re on the Main Menu
4. Navigate Settings > Bluetooth and then enable the setting
5. Try to connect your Bluetooth device to what you were trying to do before

### 2.3 Clear the Bluetooth cache

![android bluetooth problems - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-cache.jpg)

Every service on your Itel P55 using a feature called a cache. This is where information is stored to help the feature run properly and give you the best experience. However, over time this can get messy and can cause problems with your Bluetooth feature.

By clearing the cache, you can restart the service and hopefully clear up any issues or problems you may be experiencing.

1. On your phone, navigate Settings > Application Manager, and you’ll see all the apps and services on your phone. Locate and select the Bluetooth service.
2. Select the Storage option
3. Tap the Clear Cache option
4. Go back of the Menu and restart your phone
5. Now turn your Bluetooth feature on and turn connecting it to your preferred device

### 2.4 Remove paired devices

![android bluetooth problems - remove paired devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-paried.jpg)

Sometimes, you may have a problem with the Itel P55 device you’re trying to connect to via Bluetooth, especially if this is a device you’ve updated. To counter and repair this, you’re going to need to remove the paired devices saved with your device and then reconnect them.

Here’s how;

1. From the Main Menu of your Itel P55, head to Settings > Bluetooth > Connected Devices.
2. Turn Bluetooth on, and you’ll see all the connections your Itel P55 is paired with
3. Go through these settings and remove/delete/forget every connection on your device
4. Now when you go to connect to a device using Bluetooth, repair the Itel P55 device, enter the passcode, and use a fresh paired connection.

### 2.5 Use Bluetooth in safe mode

![android bluetooth problems - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-safemode.jpg)

If you’re having problems with your connection and paired devices, sometimes you may have conflicting software faults in your device that are causing the problems. If this is the case, you’ll need to boot your Itel P55 in Safe Mode.

This is an operating state in which your phone will run the bare minimum services it needs to perform. If your Bluetooth works in Safe Mode, you know you have an app or a service that’s causing the problem.

Here’s how to find out;

1. Hold the power button down, so the Android power menu turns on
2. Long-press the power button again and the restart in Safe Mode option will come up
3. The phone will automatically boot into Safe Mode
4. Wait a minute on the Main Menu
5. Now turn on your Bluetooth and connect it to your preferred device

### 2.6 Turn on the discoverable feature

![android bluetooth problems - discoverable feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-discoverable.jpg)

To ensure your Bluetooth can connect to other devices, it’s important to make sure you’re making your device discoverable to other Bluetooth devices. If it’s hidden, other devices won’t be able to find it, and sometimes it can bug and prevent connections.

Here’s how to turn on your Bluetooth discoverable feature;

1. From the home screen of your Android, navigate to the Menu> Settings > Bluetooth
2. Toggle the Bluetooth switch, so it’s on
3. Under the available settings, tick the box that allows your Bluetooth device to be discoverable
4. Turn your Bluetooth feature on and connect to the Itel P55 device you’re trying to connect too

### 2.7 Exclude Bluetooth issues of the other device

![android bluetooth problems - exclude Bluetooth issues of others](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-newphone.jpeg)

Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your Itel P55, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

1. Disconnect your Itel P55 from the Bluetooth device and turn your Bluetooth off
2. Now take another Bluetooth device and connect this to the Itel P55 device you’re trying to connect too. This could be another Android device, or even a computer or iOS device
3. If the new device doesn’t connect to your Bluetooth device, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Bluetooth device, not your Itel P55
4. If the Itel P55 devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Itel P55

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the Itel P55 devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Itel P55 to the Itel P55 device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.

## Fix the Error of Unfortunately the Process.com.android.phone Has Stopped on Itel P55

Nowadays, smartphones are integral to life. They serve as your communication lifeline and powerful personal assistant. However, it can be frustrating when a sudden error disrupts our phone's functionality. One common error Android users encounter is the "Unfortunately, The process.com.android.phone has stopped" error. Fear not if you have come across this error message on your Itel P55.

This beginner's guide is here to help you understand the causes of this problem. It will also provide you with practical "unfortunately the phone has stopped solutions."

## Part 1: Learn Why Unfortunately the process.com.android.phone Has Stopped

The error message "****Unfortunately,**** ****the process com.android.phone has stopped****" typically appears on Android devices when there is an issue with the Phone app. Issues with underlying processes responsible for handling phone-related functions are also a cause.

![process com.android.phone has stopped error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/process-com-android-1.jpg)

It can prevent you from making or receiving phone calls, accessing contacts, or using other phone-related features. Following are some of the possible reasons why you may encounter this error:

### App or System Update

When you update your device's OS or the Phone app itself, it is possible to encounter bugs or compatibility issues. These issues can lead to the Phone app crashing and displaying this error message. Sometimes, the updated software may not work with the existing configurations of the Phone app. It results in instability which causes this error.

### App Cache/Data Corruption

The Phone app relies on cached data and stored settings to function properly. If the cache or data of the app becomes corrupted, it can cause the Phone app to malfunction. The reasons include interrupted app installations or updates, improper shutdowns, or software conflicts. As a result, you may see the error message indicating that the process com.android.phone has stopped.

### Insufficient System Resources

Android devices need sufficient memory (RAM) and processing power to run apps smoothly. If your device is running low on memory or processing capacity, it may struggle to handle the Phone app and its processes. It can lead to crashes and the error message. Running many resource-intensive apps at the same time also causes this issue. Other reasons include too many background processes that contribute to this error.

### Conflicting Third-Party Apps

Third-party apps installed on your device can sometimes conflict with the Phone app. These conflicts can occur for various reasons, such as incompatible app versions. The software bugs within the third-party apps or configurations can also clash with the Phone app. Such conflicts can disrupt the normal operation of the Phone app. The result of all this trigger the error message.

### Software or Firmware Glitches

Software glitches or firmware issues can occasionally occur in Android devices. These glitches can affect the functioning of system processes, including the Phone app. They may arise from programming errors and system inconsistencies.
