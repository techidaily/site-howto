However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Infinix Hot 30i touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Infinix Hot 30i phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Infinix Hot 30i touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Infinix Hot 30i Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Infinix Hot 30i phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Infinix Hot 30i screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Infinix Hot 30i Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Infinix Hot 30i device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Infinix Hot 30i screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Infinix Hot 30i model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Infinix Hot 30i Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Infinix Hot 30i Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Infinix Hot 30i screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)
