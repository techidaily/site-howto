## Part 1: Reasons Behind Your Device Isn’t Compatible With This Version Play Store

Encountering the frustrating "**your device isn’t compatible with this version Google Play**" error can be disruptive. That's why it is essential to go through the underlying reasons causing this compatibility issue:

### 1\. Outdated Operating System Firmware

One of the primary culprits behind the compatibility error is [<u>outdated OS firmware</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html). App developers release updates to keep up with the latest features and security patches. That's why an obsolete OS version on your device may render it incompatible with the newer app versions available on the Google Play Store.

### 2\. Insufficient Hardware Requirements

Each application has specific hardware prerequisites that your device needs to fulfill. In case your smartphone does not meet the required specifications, you won't be able to utilize the app. Thus, Google Play Store may restrict access to certain applications, citing compatibility issues.

### 3\. Corrupted Cache Files

Cache files are designed to enhance the speed and efficiency of app loading. Yet, they can sometimes become corrupt. When this occurs, it disrupts the app's normal operation. Clearing these corrupted cache files is often a crucial step.

### 4\. Beta Versions and Unstable Releases

Engaging with beta versions or unstable releases of an app can result in compatibility issues. These versions are typically in the testing phase. That's why their compatibility with a wide range of devices may not be guaranteed. If you find yourself facing compatibility errors, it's worth checking if you are in a beta program.

A **touchscreen malfunctioning** can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.

### Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While

**Touch problems** also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.

### Method 4: Restart Your Android

Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a **touchscreen problem** on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.

![android restart method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg)

To restart your Android, press and hold the **Power** button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the **Power** button as well as the **Volume Down** button at the same time.

### Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android

Before attempting to have your device checked for any hardware defects, you should try completing a Factory Reset. To do this, go to **Settings > Backup and Reset.** Next, tap on **Factory data reset** \> **Delete all**.

![android factory data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg)

Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.

### Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode

If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.

**Note**

Placing your Android into **Recovery Mode** is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Xiaomi 13T.

**Step 1A**: Press and hold the **Power** button and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.

**Step 1B**: If your Xiaomi 13T still has a **Home** button, press and hold the **Home** button and the **Power** button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.

**Step 1C**: If step 1A did not put your Android into **Recovery Mode**, press and hold the **Power** and **Volume Up** and **Down** buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.

**Step 2**: Use the **Volume** buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data/factory reset, and confirm your choice with the **Power** button.

![android recovery mode 02](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg)

**Step 3**: Wait for the process to complete and for your Xiaomi 13T to restart automatically.

### Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen

If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the **touchscreen problem,** it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Xiaomi 13T checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.

### Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center

Your **phone touch problem** might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced. If your Android is still unresponsive, it’s best to bring your smartphone to an authorized service center or directly to the phone manufacturer, especially when all efforts are exhausted.
