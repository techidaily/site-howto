Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Realme 11 Pro device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Realme 11 Pro, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Realme 11 Pro device itself may be necessary in severe cases.

Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Realme 11 Pro device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Realme 11 Pro App Store.
