It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Infinix Smart 8 HD showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Infinix Smart 8 HD.

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Infinix Smart 8 HD can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

4. **Firewall restrictions**
