## Part 5. Check for the Android update

![snapchat stopping - check for android update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-update-firmware.png)

Similar to some of the other solutions we’ve listed above, if you’re using an outdated version of the Android operating system, but the latest version of Snapchat is coded to the most recent, this can be a cause for the Snapchat crashing on Android problem to occur.

## Part 6. Connect to another Wi-Fi

In some cases, you may be trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network that’s not very stable. This may keep cutting the connection to your device, which in turn is causing Snapchat to crash on Android.

To resolve this, you can simply try connecting to another Wi-Fi network or a data plan to see whether this is the problem. If so, changing network and then using the Snapchat app should stop any error messages from occurring.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Honor Magic V2, followed by the Wi-Fi option.

If you’re running a custom Android ROM on your device, with some versions of the ROM and some apps, you’re going to experience errors simply because of the way the apps and the ROMs are coded and designed.

Unfortunately, there’s no easy fix to this, and if you want to continue using the app, you’ll need to reflash your Honor Magic V2 back to its original firmware, and then wait until the ROM developers update the ROM to be compatible with social apps like Snapchat.

This can happen to various models, such as the Honor Magic V2, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Honor Magic V2 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Honor Magic V2 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Honor Magic V2 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Honor Magic V2 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Honor Magic V2 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Honor Magic V2 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
