## Common Causes of Honor 90 Screen Unresponsiveness

While Honor 90 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Honor 90 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Honor 90, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Honor 90 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Honor 90 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Honor 90 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Honor 90 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Honor 90 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Honor 90 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Honor 90 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Honor 90 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent Honor 90 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Honor 90 device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid Honor 90 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Honor 90 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Honor 90 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Honor 90 App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Honor 90 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data.
