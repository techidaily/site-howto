Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 3: Depending on your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ model, look for “IP Settings” and tap on it. Now, switch the “DHCP” to “Static”.

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.
