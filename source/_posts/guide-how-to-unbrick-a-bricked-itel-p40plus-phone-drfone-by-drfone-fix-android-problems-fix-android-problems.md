However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Itel P40+ touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Itel P40+ phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Itel P40+ touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Itel P40+ Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Itel P40+ phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Itel P40+ screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Itel P40+ Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Itel P40+ device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Itel P40+ screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Itel P40+ model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Itel P40+ Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Itel P40+ Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Itel P40+ screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Itel P40+ model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Itel P40+ black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Itel P40+'s touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Itel P40+ device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Itel P40+ device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Itel P40+logo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Itel P40+ device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Itel P40+ device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Itel P40+ device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Itel P40+ device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Itel P40+ device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Itel P40+ Y2 and Itel P40+ 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Itel P40+ device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

![clear cached data on xiaomi 5a](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/clear-cached-data-on-xiaomi5a.png)

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Itel P40+ device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Itel P40+ device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Itel P40+ device, so it should only be considered a last resort.
