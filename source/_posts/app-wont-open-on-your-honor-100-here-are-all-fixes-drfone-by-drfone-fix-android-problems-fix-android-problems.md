### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 1: Head to the “Settings” of your Honor 100 and then opt for “Wireless and Networks” followed by “WLAN/WiFi”.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 3: Depending on your Honor 100 model, look for “IP Settings” and tap on it. Now, switch the “DHCP” to “Static”.

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.

![change dhcp settings of wifi](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/dhcp-static.jpg)

### Check carefully for duplicate Wi-Fi names before you connect

Perhaps, you might connect to a WiFi with a similar name. There are good chances that some users do not modify their WiFi network name and possibly, your neighbor may have the same WiFi network, service provider. Therefore, ensure you connect to the correct WiFi network.

### Reset the Wifi network

One of the easiest ways to fix the authentication problem of Wifi is to reset the network. To do this, you would be required to forget the respective network first and then connect to it again. This can be done by simply following these steps.

1\. Firstly, you need to forget a Wifi network. To do it, go to your phone’s Settings > WiFi and network. From here, you can see a list of all the Wifi hotspots that your phone connects to. Select the network you wish to forget.

![Select the network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981516957952.jpg)

2\. When you would select a network, it will provide the basic information related to it. Just tap on the “Forget” button and agree to the pop-up message. This will erase the network’s information from your device.

![tap on the “Forget”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981517891308.jpg)

3\. Afterward, turn on your Wifi again and tap to the network you wish to connect to. Simply provide the credentials and tap on the “Connect” button to reestablish the connection. This way, you can reset the network successfully.

![tap on the Connect button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981518275903.jpg)

### Modify network connection

If the above solution won’t work, then you would be required to walk the extra mile to fix the Honor 100 Wifi problem.
