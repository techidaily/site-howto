Similar to some of the other solutions we’ve listed above, if you’re using an outdated version of the Android operating system, but the latest version of Snapchat is coded to the most recent, this can be a cause for the Snapchat crashing on Android problem to occur.

If you’re running a custom Android ROM on your device, with some versions of the ROM and some apps, you’re going to experience errors simply because of the way the apps and the ROMs are coded and designed.

Unfortunately, there’s no easy fix to this, and if you want to continue using the app, you’ll need to reflash your Honor 100 Pro back to its original firmware, and then wait until the ROM developers update the ROM to be compatible with social apps like Snapchat.

One of the last resorts you can take is factory resetting your Honor 100 Pro back to its original settings. From the day you first started using your device, you’ve been using the system and downloading files and apps, and over time this increases the chances of creating a bug.

For instance, your device will be able to run sans any third-party apps when in Safe mode. Since the important functions and the naïve apps will be running on the Honor 100 Pro device, you will get to know if it’s really a software glitch or not by running the Phone app in Safe mode.

1. Open "Settings" on your device and go to "Application" or "Apps".
2. Now from the list of all applications, go to "Phone" and tap on it.

![Phone app crashing - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-phone.jpg)

### 2.3 Update Google Play services

Since Android is created by Google, there must be some Google Play services that are crucial to run several system functions. And if attempting the previous methods isn’t of any use, try updating Google Play services when you find the Phone app stopped. For doing this, you need to make sure that automatic updates are turned on in Google settings. If not, enable it and get the apps including Google Play services updated for smoother functions.

### 2.4 Update the Honor 100 Pro firmware
