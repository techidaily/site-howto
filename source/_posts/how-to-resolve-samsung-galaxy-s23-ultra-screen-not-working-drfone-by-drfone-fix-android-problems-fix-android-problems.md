This can happen to various models, such as the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Protecting the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
