## Common Causes of Poco C50 Screen Unresponsiveness

While Poco C50 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Poco C50 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Poco C50, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Poco C50 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Poco C50 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Poco C50 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Poco C50 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Poco C50 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Poco C50 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Poco C50 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Poco C50 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent Poco C50 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Poco C50 device software up-to-date.

Another way to avoid Poco C50 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Poco C50 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Poco C50 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Poco C50 App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Poco C50 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data.

### Reset Factory settings

If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.

Along with this, we would also suggest you go take backup of your data so that you won’t lose any of the personal information from your device after performing factory reset. For your convenience, we have stated the backup steps too in the following guide. Have a look:

- Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup & Reset”.
- Notice if “Back up my data” is enabled or not. If not, turn it on and create backup.
- Now, scroll for “Factory Data reset” option and confirm it by clicking “Reset Phone”.

- Wait a few minutes and your device will reboot.

### Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz

We believe that you will find the above methods helpful. However, if still in case your **_TouchWiz is not working_**, we advice you that you should install a new theme launcher in your device. It will be a wise option to ditch TouchWiz in such scenario rather than tolerating the problem. Hope this advice will help you.
