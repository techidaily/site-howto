It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

2. **Internet connection issues**

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.

3. **Glitches or bugs**

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

In some cases, a firewall on your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ might be overly restrictive, preventing the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device from establishing a connection to the internet.
