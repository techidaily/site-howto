You’ve probably seen this error message before, especially when taking screenshots of banking or video streaming apps. But why do apps and websites block screenshots? It’s actually for your good.

Screenshots can be misused to steal money or pirate copyrighted content. By prohibiting screenshots, apps and websites can help to protect your data and privacy. If you want to learn more, keep reading. This article will explain why apps and websites prevent screenshot capture and why it’s important for security. We’ll also give you tips on how to take photos of apps and websites that don’t let you take screenshots.

## Part 1. Can’t Take Screenshots Due to Security Policy on Android? Here’s Why

Why can’t you take a screenshot of something on your phone and get the error message that says, “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**”? Apps and websites turn off or remove the screenshot feature for a variety of reasons, including:

Device Restrictions

Lots of workplaces and schools have rules against taking screenshots on devices used for work or school. Organizations do this to protect sensitive information and prevent data breaches.

Protect Sensitive Information

Say you’re trying to take a screenshot on your Realme 10T 5G device, and you get the notification “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy.” Realme 10T 5G** smartphones are not necessarily the problem.

Some apps and websites, such as banking apps, store private data like financial and credit card details. Blocking capturing screenshots is a way to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information.

![cryptocurrency app screenshot error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-02.jpg)

Follow Regulations

Some industries and organizations have regulations that need them to protect sensitive data. Financial institutions must protect their customers’ financial information, for example. Disabling screenshots is one way to follow these regulations.

DRM-Protected Content

**Android can’t take screenshots due to security policy**, especially to prevent piracy. Piracy is the distribution of copyrighted material without permission. It can harm businesses that depend on copyright protection.

To prevent this, you can use DRM (digital rights management) to protect copyrighted content. DRM-protected content cannot be screenshotted or copied.

Prevent Fraud

Scammers and other criminals often use screenshots to commit fraud. For instance, people might send fake screenshots to trick others into sharing personal details or money. Disabling screenshots can help to prevent this type of fraud.

Protect Intellectual Property

Many businesses and organizations have valuable information they want to keep safe, such as trade secrets. Disabling screenshots can be helpful to prevent the theft of this intellectual property.

Protect User Privacy

Some apps and websites allow users to share private information. Some apps, like messaging apps, let users share private info. But there are limits.

You **can’t take screenshots due to security policy Whatsapp** features, View Once media option. This method stops people from taking pictures of private media chats, protecting users’ privacy.

Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots

You can download several applications on Google Play Store if you still can’t take a screenshot due to security policy. Some popular third-party screenshot apps include:

This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.

Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions

Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.

Screen Mirroring

- **Step 1:** Swipe down the top of the screen to access the **Quick Settings** panel.

- **Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.
- **Backup your phone data regularly:** Backing up your phone safeguards your data in the event that you lose it, it is stolen, or it no longer works. When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.
- **Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:** Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.
