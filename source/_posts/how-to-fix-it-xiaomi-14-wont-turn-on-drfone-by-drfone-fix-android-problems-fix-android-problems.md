Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Xiaomi 14 device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Xiaomi 14 to become slower and eventually get stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

Wiping out the cache data from your Xiaomi 14 could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.

### 5. Factory Reset

If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.

Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Xiaomi 14:

**Step 1:** Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time

**Step 2:** Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data/factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.
