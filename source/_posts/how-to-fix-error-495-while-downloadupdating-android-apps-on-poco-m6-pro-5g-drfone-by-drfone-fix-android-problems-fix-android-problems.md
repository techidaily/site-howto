## Part 5. Check for the Android update

![snapchat stopping - check for android update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-update-firmware.png)

Similar to some of the other solutions we’ve listed above, if you’re using an outdated version of the Android operating system, but the latest version of Snapchat is coded to the most recent, this can be a cause for the Snapchat crashing on Android problem to occur.

Fortunately, it’s easy to check to make sure you’re running the latest version of Android and to download and install the update if you need it. Here’s how, which will help to sort out your Snapchat keeps crashing Android problems.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Poco M6 Pro 5G and select the About Phone option.

**Step 2:** Tap the ‘Check for Updates’ option. If an update is available, you’ll then have the option to Install Now or Install Overnight. If no update is available, you’ll see a notification stating your device is up to date and no action is needed.

## Part 6. Connect to another Wi-Fi

In some cases, you may be trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network that’s not very stable. This may keep cutting the connection to your device, which in turn is causing Snapchat to crash on Android.

To resolve this, you can simply try connecting to another Wi-Fi network or a data plan to see whether this is the problem. If so, changing network and then using the Snapchat app should stop any error messages from occurring.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Poco M6 Pro 5G, followed by the Wi-Fi option.

![snapchat stopping - connect to wifi](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-change1.png)

**Step 2:** Tap the new Wi-Fi network you’re currently connected to, and then tap the ‘Forget’ option, to stop your phone connecting to it.

## Part 7. Stop using the custom ROM

If you’re running a custom Android ROM on your device, with some versions of the ROM and some apps, you’re going to experience errors simply because of the way the apps and the ROMs are coded and designed.

Unfortunately, there’s no easy fix to this, and if you want to continue using the app, you’ll need to reflash your Poco M6 Pro 5G back to its original firmware, and then wait until the ROM developers update the ROM to be compatible with social apps like Snapchat.

However, this reflashing process is simple thanks to the Dr.Fone - System Repair (Android) software that we listed above. To follow the detailed step-by-step guide, follow the steps on Part 4 of this article, or follow the quick guide instructions below.

1. Download and install the [Dr.Fone - System Repair (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-repair/) software to your computer
2. Connect your Poco M6 Pro 5G to your Windows computer using the USB cable
3. Open the software and click the Repair option.
4. Select the Android device repair option
5. Make sure your carrier and device information are correct
6. Put your device into Download Mode by following the onscreen instructions
7. Allow the software to repair your Poco M6 Pro 5G automatically

## Part 8. Reset the factory settings of your Android

![snapchat stopping - factory resetting](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-factory-reset.jpg)

One of the last resorts you can take is factory resetting your Poco M6 Pro 5G back to its original settings. From the day you first started using your device, you’ve been using the system and downloading files and apps, and over time this increases the chances of creating a bug.

However, by resetting your device to factory settings, you can reset these bugs and get your apps and device working again free from the Unfortunately, Snapchat has stopped error message. Here’s how to factory reset your device.

Make sure you back up your personal files from your device first like your photos and music files because factory resetting your device will clear your device’s memory.

**Step 1:** Tap the Settings menu on your device and click the Backup and Reset option.

**Step 2:** Click the Reset Phone option. That’s it! The phone will take several minutes to complete the process, after which your phone will be reset to its original state.
