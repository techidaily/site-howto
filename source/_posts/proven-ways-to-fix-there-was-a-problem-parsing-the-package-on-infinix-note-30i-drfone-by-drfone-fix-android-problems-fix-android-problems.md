1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Infinix Note 30i showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Infinix Note 30i. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My Infinix Note 30i offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Infinix Note 30i can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.
