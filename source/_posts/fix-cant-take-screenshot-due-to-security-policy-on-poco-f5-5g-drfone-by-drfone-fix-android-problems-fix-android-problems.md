We’ll also give you tips on how to take photos of apps and websites that don’t let you take screenshots.

## Part 1. Can’t Take Screenshots Due to Security Policy on Android? Here’s Why

Why can’t you take a screenshot of something on your phone and get the error message that says, “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**”? Apps and websites turn off or remove the screenshot feature for a variety of reasons, including:

To prevent this, you can use DRM (digital rights management) to protect copyrighted content. DRM-protected content cannot be screenshotted or copied.

Prevent Fraud

Scammers and other criminals often use screenshots to commit fraud. For instance, people might send fake screenshots to trick others into sharing personal details or money. Disabling screenshots can help to prevent this type of fraud.

Protect Intellectual Property

Many businesses and organizations have valuable information they want to keep safe, such as trade secrets. Disabling screenshots can be helpful to prevent the theft of this intellectual property.

Protect User Privacy

Some apps and websites allow users to share private information. Some apps, like messaging apps, let users share private info. But there are limits.

## Part 2. 8 Ways To Take Screenshots When You Can’t Due to Security Policy

If you’re trying to take a screenshot of an app or website with a security policy in place, there’s usually no way to circumvent it. However, there are a few things you can do to take pictures of these apps and website content.

Enable Screen Capture on Android

Sudden “**can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” notifications, failing to take a screenshot, and a Poco F5 5G user?

If you are using this Android device, you can enable the screen capture feature in the Settings app.

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** > **Apps**, then tap the **More options** icon in the upper right corner.

![android app settings interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-04.jpg)

![enable samsung capture](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-06.jpg)

Once you have enabled screen capture, you can check if you can take screenshots of any app or website.

Enable Screenshots in Incognito Mode

Apps and websites may prohibit screenshots in incognito mode to protect your privacy. However, you can enable the Incognito Screenshot experimental flag in Chrome to bypass this restriction.

- **Step 1:** Open Chrome on your Poco F5 5G and type “chrome://flags” in the address bar.

![chrome experimental flags](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-07.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Search for Incognito Screenshot and choose **Enabled** from the drop-down menu.

![incognito screenshot enabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-08.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Tap **Relaunch** on the lower right corner of the screen.

![google assistant command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-09.jpg)

Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots

You can download several applications on Google Play Store if you still can’t take a screenshot due to security policy. Some popular third-party screenshot apps include:

- Screenshot Easy
- Screenshot Tile
- Screen Master: Screenshot Markup

Third-party screenshot apps often use different methods to capture the screen. These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.

Capture Your Phone Display With Another Device

If you own another smartphone, you can use it to take a photo of the screen of the Poco F5 5G device you’re trying to take a screenshot of. This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.

Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions

Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.

Screen Mirroring

Smart View allows you to display your Poco F5 5G device’s screen on your smart TV, where you can then take a screenshot of the TV to capture the app or website you need.

- **Step 1:** Swipe down the top of the screen to access the **Quick Settings** panel.

- **Step 3:** Select your TV from the list of available devices and tap **Start Now**.

![cast samsung phone using smart view](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-10.jpg)

Alternatively, if you don’t have a smart TV, you can still mirror your phone screen display to your desktop or tablet using the Poco F5 5G Flow app and take a screenshot of your phone’s screen instead.

![android screen problems intro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Is My Android Experiencing Touch Screen Problems

Below are some of the most common reasons you’re experiencing touch problems on your Android smartphone.

- The **touchscreen problem**freezes your phone, lags, or hangs.
- Some parts of the screen work fine, but some don’t.
- Your screen responds inaccurately (typing “a” gets you “q” or “z”).
- The touchscreen is automatically operating itself, resulting in ghost touch.
- It doesn’t respond to any taps, and the phone’s screen has stopped working.
- The device is physically damaged, or the screen is cracked or broken.
- Outdated devices are prone to the black/white/blue screen of death.

## Part 2: Tips, Fixes, and Workarounds To Fix Your Poco F5 5G Touch Problems

If any of the outlined reasons above are the cause of your **touch screen malfunctioning,** here are some solutions to fix it.

### Method 1: Remove the Screen Protector and Phone Case

Some phone cases and screen protectors cause **touch problems** on your Android screen. This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.

![android remove screen protector](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg)

### Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone

A **touchscreen malfunctioning** can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.

![android dirty screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg)

### Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While

**Touch problems** also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.

### Method 4: Restart Your Android

Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a **touchscreen problem** on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.

![android restart method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg)

To restart your Android, press and hold the **Power** button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the **Power** button as well as the **Volume Down** button at the same time.

### Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android

Before attempting to have your device checked for any hardware defects, you should try completing a Factory Reset. To do this, go to **Settings > Backup and Reset.** Next, tap on **Factory data reset** \> **Delete all**.

![android factory data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg)

Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.

### Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode

If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.

**Note**

Placing your Android into **Recovery Mode** is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Poco F5 5G.

**Step 1A**: Press and hold the **Power** button and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.

**Step 1B**: If your Poco F5 5G still has a **Home** button, press and hold the **Home** button and the **Power** button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.

**Step 1C**: If step 1A did not put your Android into **Recovery Mode**, press and hold the **Power** and **Volume Up** and **Down** buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.

![android recovery mode 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg)

**Step 2**: Use the **Volume** buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data/factory reset, and confirm your choice with the **Power** button.

![android recovery mode 02](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg)

**Step 3**: Wait for the process to complete and for your Poco F5 5G to restart automatically.

### Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen

If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the **touchscreen problem,** it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Poco F5 5G checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.

![图像](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-08.jpg)"

### Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center

Your **phone touch problem** might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced. If your Android is still unresponsive, it’s best to bring your smartphone to an authorized service center or directly to the phone manufacturer, especially when all efforts are exhausted.
