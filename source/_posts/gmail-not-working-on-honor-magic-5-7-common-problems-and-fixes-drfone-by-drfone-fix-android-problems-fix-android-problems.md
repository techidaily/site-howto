## Problem 2: Gmail won’t sync between all ends

The next most common problem where people get stuck with is when there Gmail won’t sync. Here are the solutions to this particular problem.

## Problem 3: Gmail won’t load

In case you are using the Gmail over your web browser and it has tested your patience in loading, here are the solutions that could prove to be fruitful for you. Please check these out.

### Ensure to Use Gmail Supported Browser

First of all, you need to make sure that the browser you are using works with Gmail or not. Gmail can smoothly perform in Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. However, the browsers should be updated. So, please make sure that these browsers are running on the latest versions. Moreover, in case you use Chromebook, don’t forget to update the operating system in order to let it support Gmail.

### Clear Cache of web browser

If you tried the above method but to no avail, try to clear the cache and cookies of the web browser. But by doing so, the browser history will be removed. As well as, the records of the websites you previously enjoyed will also be lost.

### Check browser extensions or add-ons

 If not the above one, try this tip. It encourages you to check your browser extensions. Perhaps these are interfering with the Gmail and due to this conflict, Gmail won’t load. You can either turn off these extensions and plug-ins temporarily or make use of the incognito mode of the browser where there are no such things like extensions and plug-ins.

## Problem 4: Gmail can’t send or receive

Gmail also gives you problem in sending or receive mails and messages. And to troubleshoot such issue, following are the solutions mentioned.

### Check the Latest Version of Gmail

This issue is likely to emerge when you are using an outdated version of Gmail. And therefore, the first solution says you to check if the Gmail update is available. You can go to the Play Store and from the “My apps & games” option, you can see if Gmail needs to be updated or not.

![Gmail crashing on Android - check version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/check-update-gmail.jpg)

### Verify Internet Connection

Another thing that carries weight while you can send or receive mails is the internet connection. As we all know that Gmail won’t respond if the Honor Magic 5 device is not connected to the internet. Therefore, you are advised to turn off Wi-Fi and then enable it again. Also, please ensure to switch to Wi-Fi if you are using the cellular data. This may hamper the process and stop you from receiving or sending mails.

### Remove you Account and Add Again

If still Gmail keeps stopping you to go ahead, make sure to once sign out from it. To do this:

## Problem 5: Stuck in sending

Now, here is another annoying problem that doesn’t let Gmail working on Android properly. This problem addresses the situation where users send a mail but it gets stuck on sending. If this is the problem that you are going through, the following solutions will help you.

### Try Alternative Gmail Address

First of all, if Gmail is not working due to stuck in sending issue, we advise you to make use of some other Gmail address to send the mail. If the problem still occurs, jump to the next solution.

### Check Network Connection

As already mentioned, be sure of an active internet connection while working with Gmail. When you are not using a stable connection, it may lead to stuck on sending, Gmail crashing and many other issues. You can fix the issue by doing these three things:

1. Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.
2. Turn off Wi-Fi and then turn it on again after nearly 5 seconds. Do the same with the router. Plug it out and the plug in.
3. Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.

Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.

### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending. If these are not so important, you can remove them and send the mail. Or if it is not possible to send the mail without attachments, compressing the files can be a solution.

## Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue

Many times, the users get the error that says “Account not synced” while they try to work with Gmail. And this is the 6<sup>th</sup> problem we are introducing. The ways mentioned below will assist to get out of the trouble.

### Make Space in the Phone

When Gmail stops to further the process by prompting “Accounts not synced” issue, be sure that your Honor Magic 5 has some storage in it. If not, create it straight away. As we also mentioned in one of the above solutions, you can either delete the unnecessary files or transfer the important files to the PC to make the space in the phone. Go along with this tip and see if it works.

### Check Gmail Sync Settings

### Restart the Honor Magic 5 device

If the above method went futile, simply restart your device. Take help of the Power button on your device. Long press it and from the options, restart it. This will hopefully work for you.

## Problem 7: Gmail app running slow

The last problem that you may face is the slow-going Gmail app. In simple words, you may experience that Gmail app is operating extremely slowly. To fix this, following solutions will help you.

### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your Honor Magic 5 in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.

### Clear Storage of Device

Usually all the apps start running slow when the Honor Magic 5 device is not having sufficient space. As the apps need space to function quickly and appropriately, having the Honor Magic 5 device on low storage can prove to be a bad luck for Gmail. So, make sure you wipe out the items you no longer needed on your device and create some room so that the Gmail responds nicely and won’t be running slow anymore.

### Update Gmail App

As the last tip that will indeed help you is to update the Gmail app. Until you update the app when required, Gmail keeps stopping you from working and you will definitely get frustrated. Therefore, go to Play Store and look for the Gmail update. If it is available, welcome it with smile and bid farewell to the problem of slow running Gmail.

What if your problem still doesn’t get resolved after following these 3 tips? Well! If that is the case, we will again recommend you to make use of an expert one-click tool to flash the stock Android ROM.
