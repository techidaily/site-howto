## Part 2. 10 common ways to fix Android won't charge

### 1\. Check/replace charging cable

Charging cables fray or become defunct after prolonged usage. Therefore, it is advised to always use the Realme 11 5G device’s original charging cable or purchase a good quality charging cord, which doesn't damage your device or your adapter.

It is also very commonly observed that the charging end of the cable which gets connected to the charging port of the Realme 11 5G device gets damaged and prevents the current from flowing to the phone/tablet.

![charging cable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459762305.jpg)

### 2\. Check/clean charging port

The charging port in your device is a small opening where the charging end of the cabbie is inserted for the current to flow to the phone/tablet. Very often, we notice that the charging port gets blocked with tiny particles of dirt. The charging port might also get clogged if dirt and dust get accumulated in it, preventing the sensors from receiving and forwarding the current to the Realme 11 5G device.

![check charging port](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459938188.jpg)

The best way to take this problem is to clean the port with a blunt pin or a soft bristle unused toothbrush. Make sure you clean the port gently and do not damage it or its sensors.

![clean charging port](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985460097930.jpg)

### 3\. Check/replace charging adapter

This method is fairly simple, and all you need to do is check whether or not the charging adapter is working properly as sometimes, the adapter itself is to be blamed for the charge. To make sure that you are not using a defective adapter, connect your charging cable/USB to another adapter. If your device charges normally, it means there is a problem is with your adapter, and you must replace it at the earliest to solve My Realme 11 5G won't charge the issue.

![check charging adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985010302112.jpg)

### 4\. Try another power source

This technique is more like a quick trick. It means to switch from one power source to another or use a more efficient and suitable power source. Laptops and PCs charge slower than a direct power source, i.e., a wall socket. Sometimes, the charging speed is slower, and the battery is draining. In such a scenario, choose to charge your device by directly plugging it into a socket on the wall to never experience My Realme 11 5G won't charge problem.

Follow the steps given below to clear your device’s cache:
