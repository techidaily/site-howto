In this post, we will make you familiar with the root cause for the Huawei P60 Wifi problem and how you can resolve whenever authentication error occurred on your device.

## Part 1: Any idea about the Wi-Fi authentication problem?

Wi-Fi authentication has to be done every time you wish to connect to a Wi-Fi network over your smartphone or laptop.

But if after you’re putting in the correct password and still experiencing the wifi authentication problem. Here’s what you need to know.

Authentication error occurs when the “deal” between the Wi-Fi router and device fails due to certain reasons. First, the Huawei P60 device sends the password of the network and the "connect" request in an encrypted format to the Wi-Fi router. Then, the router decrypts the password and compares the password saved on it. Now, if the password matches, it sends affirmation for the "connect" request, and then the Huawei P60 device is allowed to connect to the network.

## Part 2: Why Authentication Error Occurred when Connecting to Wifi?

There could be plenty of reasons for facing an authentication error on your device. Most of the time, it occurs whenever a Wifi router seems to malfunction. Furthermore, if your phone has been recently updated, then chances are that there could be an issue with its drivers. A security attack can also make your device malfunction as well. An unstable connection or a router blockage can also be a reason for this issue.

In this scenario, whenever you try to connect to a Wifi network (even after supplying the correct password and username), it doesn’t connect to it. Instead, it displays an authentication error occurred promptly. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways to overcome the authentication problem Wifi. In the next section, we have provided three different solutions to fix the Huawei P60 Wifi problem (as it mostly happens on Android devices).

### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 1: Head to the “Settings” of your Huawei P60 and then opt for “Wireless and Networks” followed by “WLAN/WiFi”.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 3: Depending on your Huawei P60 model, look for “IP Settings” and tap on it. Now, switch the “DHCP” to “Static”.

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.

### Reset the Wifi network

One of the easiest ways to fix the authentication problem of Wifi is to reset the network. To do this, you would be required to forget the respective network first and then connect to it again. This can be done by simply following these steps.

1\. Firstly, you need to forget a Wifi network. To do it, go to your phone’s Settings > WiFi and network. From here, you can see a list of all the Wifi hotspots that your phone connects to. Select the network you wish to forget.

### Update Android firmware to the latest

There are instances where an outdated OS version of your Huawei P60 may create a hindrance in establishing a connection between your device and the WiFi network. You need to update your Android firmware to the latest version and then check if the problem persists or not.

Step 1: Launch “Settings” of your Huawei P60 and then get into the “About Phone” option.

Step 2: Now, opt for the “System Update” option. If the update is available, get your device updated to the latest OS version.

### Restart the router and reset Android network settings

Try restarting your Wi-Fi router and then check if your device connects successfully. If this doesn’t work, try to [reset your Android Network Settings](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html#reset).

We’ll also give you tips on how to take photos of apps and websites that don’t let you take screenshots.

## Part 1. Can’t Take Screenshots Due to Security Policy on Android? Here’s Why

Some apps and websites, such as banking apps, store private data like financial and credit card details. Blocking capturing screenshots is a way to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information.

![cryptocurrency app screenshot error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-02.jpg)

Prevent Fraud

![chrome experimental flags](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-07.jpg)

## Conclusion

You can fix the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error on Android in different ways. But it depends on the cause of the error. If an app is causing the error, you can try two things. First, remove the app’s screenshot restriction. Second, download a different screenshot app or a different device to take screenshots.

Although there are ways to bypass the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error message, it’s crucial to know why screenshots are not allowed. Many apps and websites do not permit it to protect sensitive information, prevent piracy, and follow regulations. They also do it to prevent fraud, protect user privacy, and safeguard intellectual property.

If you think the issue is with your Android system, or your device becomes bricked after trying other methods, experiencing app crashes, or otherwise malfunctioning, try using the Dr.Fone System Repair tool. It is worth trying and can fix most Android system issues in a few minutes.
