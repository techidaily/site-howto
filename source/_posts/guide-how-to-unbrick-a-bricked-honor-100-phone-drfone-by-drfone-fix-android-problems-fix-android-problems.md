## Super Easy Ways To Deal with Honor 100 Unresponsive Screen

The evolution of smartphones signifies the development of mobile communication technology. Different from the initial years, they are not just used for messaging and calling but have many other applications. Honor 100 cell phones are presently utilized for perusing the Internet and exploring through maps, photography, videography, and numerous other used cases. A development in arranged availability goes hand-in-hand with the development of cell phones.

Honor 100 smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Honor 100 touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Honor 100 phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen. In this guide, you'll find the information you need to troubleshoot and fix the most common problems reported by Motorola customers.


## **What causes a Honor 100 Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Honor 100 phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Honor 100 device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Honor 100 smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Honor 100 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

### **There might be issues with the Honor 100 device itself**

Screens on Honor 100 devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every Honor 100 device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.

### **There might be errors in the updated software**

The Android operating system is adjustable. Some of our technological advancements may backfire on us. The phone won't power on or become stuck in a boot loop where the logo will only show intermittently. For example, some Honor 100 4 and 5 users have reported their screens are unresponsive after a software update, rendering the Honor 100 device unusable.

## **The common solutions to solve a Honor 100 Screen unresponsive**

Could anything be more annoying than a broken touchscreen on your Honor 100 phone? If this happens, the gadget is useless, and you won't be able to do even the simplest tasks. Even so, it's common for the screen to cease responding to touches.

Before taking the item in for repairs, see if you can figure out the problem independently. Do you want to learn the method? If the touch screens on your Honor 100 stop working, don’t panic; we'll teach you exactly what to do.

### **Solution 1: Try to restart your device**

1. Charge your phone.
2. Leave it for about an hour.
3. Come back to check. Turn your phone on.

Based on the customer’s feedback, one of the frequent issues of the Honor 100 is when the screen becomes unresponsive. These issues should not usually happen, but if you find yourself in this dilemma, a list of other solutions below will help you.
