Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Nokia 130 Music device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Nokia 130 Music, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Nokia 130 Music device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Nokia 130 Music F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Nokia 130 Music device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Nokia 130 Music Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Nokia 130 Music device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Nokia 130 Music device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Nokia 130 Music devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:

- **Router Problems**

If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.

- **Out of Wi-Fi Range**

**Why does My Nokia 130 Music keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi**? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.

- **Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked**

The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.

- **Devices Connected with Router**

Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.

- **Unstable Internet**

If your Nokia 130 Music gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.

Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.
