Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Vivo V27 Pro devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:

- **Router Problems**

If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.

- **Out of Wi-Fi Range**

**Why does My Vivo V27 Pro keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi**? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.

- **Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked**

The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.

- **Devices Connected with Router**

Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.

- **Unstable Internet**

If your Vivo V27 Pro gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.

Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.

Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty.

Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the ****Android boot screen****.

Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.

Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an ****Android phone stuck on the logo**** page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.

### 2. Android Software Updates

Updates are a common cause of ****Android phones stuck on the logo****. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been.

Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page.

If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Vivo V27 Pro to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.
