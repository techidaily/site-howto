## Full Guide: How To Fix Connection Is Not Private on Tecno Pop 8

Are you encountering the "your connection is not private" issue on your phone? We found many Android users have increasingly expressed their frustrations with this recurring problem while browsing on the internet.

Usually, you can just reload the page to fix the error. But in case it doesn't help, you may need to look for more advanced solutions. In the following discussion, we will delve into why this **"your connection is not private" on Android** happens and explore solutions that work for you.

## Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android

First of all, what does **"your connection is not private" on Android** mean? To answer this question, it's essential to understand that this error is often associated with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol issues.

SSL is a cryptographic protocol created to establish a secure communication channel over the internet. Its primary purpose is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a user's device and a website's server.

The error message appears when there's a problem with the SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate of the website you are trying to access. This certificate is a digital document that authenticates the website and encrypts the data transmitted between the user's device and the server.

![Your connection is not private error on Android.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-1.jpg)

Some common factors that could trigger the **"your connection is not private" on Chrome Android error**:

1. **Expired or invalid SSL certificate of the website;**

Certificates are issued for a specific period, and if the website owner fails to renew it in time, your browser will detect it as not secure.

2. **There is a mismatch between the domain on the certificate and the actual domain you are trying to visit;**

This discrepancy might occur due to a misconfiguration on the website or, in some cases, due to a man-in-the-middle attack where a third party intercepts the communication between your device and the server.

3. **No HTTPS enforcement;**

Another reason for the issue is if the installed SSL certificate doesn't turn on the "force HTTPS" option. This means visitors might be using the non-secure HTTP version of the site instead of the safe URL.

So, the error serves as a warning to users, indicating that the connection may not be secure and sensitive information could be at risk.

Browsers, including those on Android devices, prioritize user safety and privacy. They will block access to potentially compromised websites to prevent data theft or unauthorized access. That's why when you get the "your connection is not private" message on Android, you can't access the website.

## Part 2: What The Error Codes in "Your Connection Is Not Private" Mean

When **"your connection is not private" on Chrome Android error** shows up, it often comes along with specific error codes that can indicate the root cause of the issue. Understanding these error codes is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving the problem effectively.

1. **ERR\_CERT\_SYMANTEC\_LEGACY: Unsupported Symantec-issued certificate**

This error code indicates that the website you are attempting to access is equipped with an unsupported Symantec-issued certificate. Symantec, a prominent Certificate Authority, had faced concerns about the security of its certificate issuance processes.

As a result, major browsers, including Google Chrome, no longer support certificates issued by Symantec. If you encounter this error, it implies that the website's SSL certificate is outdated and needs to be updated with a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.

2. **NET::ERR\_CERT\_AUTHORITY\_INVALID: Unauthenticated SSL certificate**

The presence of this error code suggests that the SSL certificate of the website cannot be authenticated by your browser. This could occur if the certificate is self-signed or issued by an unrecognized Certificate Authority.

3. **NET::ERR\_CERT\_DATE\_INVALID: Date and time mismatch**

This error code points to a discrepancy between your Tecno Pop 8's date and time settings and the information on the website's SSL certificate, as they have expiration dates. If the date and time settings on your device are incorrect, it may prevent the certificate from being validated. Correcting your device's date and time settings should resolve this issue.

4. **SSL certificate error: Generic or unspecified problem**

This is a more generic error message that indicates a problem with the website's SSL certificate without specifying the exact nature of the issue. It could indicate various issues, such as an expired certificate, a misconfiguration in the certificate chain, or other SSL-related problems.

## Part 3: How To Fix Your Connection Is Not Private on Android

Encountering the **"your connection is not private" error on Android** can be a frustrating experience. Fortunately, there are various methods to address and fix this issue, depending on its underlying cause.

In this section, we will explore some effective solutions to help you regain a secure and private connection.

### Method 1: Clear your cache

When you use the internet, web browsers store information about your online activities in cached data and cookies to speed things up. However, having too much of this data can cause problems instead. It might even stop your browser from connecting securely.

So, [<u>clearing your browser cache and data </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/erase-iphone/clear-iphone-cache.html) can be a quick and simple **"your connection is not private" Android fix.** Follow the steps here:

## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

Below are the common causes why a **cell phone bricks**.

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Tecno Pop 8 device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Tecno Pop 8 device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device's OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. [Rooting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html) often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone's core functionality.

#### Installing Bad Apps

Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation. In severe cases, they can trigger a [boot loop](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/boot-loop-android.html) or render the phone unresponsive.

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.

## Part 2. Unbricking Methods and Tools

Below are solutions that you can employ to fix various brick phone scenarios.
