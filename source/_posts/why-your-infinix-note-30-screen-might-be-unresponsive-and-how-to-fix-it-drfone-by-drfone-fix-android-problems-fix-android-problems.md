Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Infinix Note 30 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Infinix Note 30, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Infinix Note 30 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Infinix Note 30 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Infinix Note 30 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Infinix Note 30 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Infinix Note 30 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Infinix Note 30 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
