## Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System

Losing data on your Nokia C210 is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don't really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here's how to easily do that.

Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Nokia C210, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the "Backup & Restore" option on the screen.

To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.

Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup & Restore from the menu list.

Step 2: Press "Restore" to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created

Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.
