## Common Causes of OnePlus 12R Screen Unresponsiveness

While OnePlus 12R devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an OnePlus 12R device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the OnePlus 12R, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an OnePlus 12R device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the OnePlus 12R F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an OnePlus 12R device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the OnePlus 12R Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the OnePlus 12R device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the OnePlus 12R device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While OnePlus 12R devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid OnePlus 12R Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid OnePlus 12R Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the OnePlus 12R device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the OnePlus 12R device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the OnePlus 12R App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent OnePlus 12R Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data.

Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the ****Android boot screen****.

Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.

Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an ****Android phone stuck on the logo**** page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.

### 2. Android Software Updates

Updates are a common cause of ****Android phones stuck on the logo****. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen**** and many others might occur.

Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.

When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your OnePlus 12R has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your ****Android phone getting stuck on the logo****.

If you noticed that your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.

To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your OnePlus 12R functioning properly.
