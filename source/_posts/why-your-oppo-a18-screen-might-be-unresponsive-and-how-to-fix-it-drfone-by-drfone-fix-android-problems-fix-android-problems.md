While Oppo A18 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Oppo A18 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Oppo A18, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Oppo A18 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Oppo A18 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Oppo A18 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Oppo A18 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Oppo A18 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Oppo A18 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Oppo A18 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Oppo A18 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent Oppo A18 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Oppo A18 device software up-to-date.

Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid Oppo A18 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Oppo A18 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Oppo A18 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Oppo A18 App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Oppo A18 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data.

Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Oppo A18 devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:

- **Router Problems**

If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.

- **Out of Wi-Fi Range**

**Why does My Oppo A18 keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi**? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.

- **Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked**

The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.

- **Devices Connected with Router**

Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.

- **Unstable Internet**

If your Oppo A18 gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.

Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.
