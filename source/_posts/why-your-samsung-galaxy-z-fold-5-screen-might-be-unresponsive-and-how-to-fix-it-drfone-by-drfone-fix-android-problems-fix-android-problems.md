This can happen to various models, such as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.
