## Part 1: What Should We Know About Itel A60 Android System WebView Crashes?

This year, the term "**Android WebView crash 2023**" has become a familiar and dreaded phrase. This issue has plagued Android users, causing app crashes, [freezing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-frozen/iphone-keeps-freezing.html), and frustration. But what exactly is Android WebView, and what triggers these apps to crash?

Android WebView is an integral component of Android apps, acting as the invisible engine that renders web content within these apps. It allows users to seamlessly browse websites, watch videos, and interact with web pages without switching to a separate browser. However, when WebView crashes, it disrupts this integrated experience, causing apps to malfunction.

Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing **Android WebView crash**. These include:

- **App Freezing**

One of the earliest signs of an **Itel A60 Android System WebView crash** is the app freezing. The app may become unresponsive, refusing to respond to your taps or gestures.

- **Unexpected App Closures**

Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. **Itel A60 Android System WebView crashing apps** can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.

- **Error Messages**

Error messages can also provide valuable clues about the impending crash. These messages may appear as pop-ups or be displayed within the app itself.

![webview crash google app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-02.jpg)

But why does WebView crash Android smartphones? The answer involves several factors:

![snapchat stopping - check for android update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-update-firmware.png)

Similar to some of the other solutions we’ve listed above, if you’re using an outdated version of the Android operating system, but the latest version of Snapchat is coded to the most recent, this can be a cause for the Snapchat crashing on Android problem to occur.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Itel A60, followed by the Wi-Fi option.

## Part 7. Stop using the custom ROM

![snapchat stopping - stop rom](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-custom-rom.jpg)
