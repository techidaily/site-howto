Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Vivo Y100i device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Vivo Y100i, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Vivo Y100i device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Vivo Y100i F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Vivo Y100i device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Vivo Y100i Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Vivo Y100i device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Vivo Y100i device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
