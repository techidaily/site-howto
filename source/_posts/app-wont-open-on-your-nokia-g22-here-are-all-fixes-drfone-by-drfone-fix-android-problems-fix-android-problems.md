Finding out the root cause of an app crashing is important so that you can find the appropriate solution. Discussed below are some of the reasons why your Android apps keep crashing:

### Insufficient Memory

When a device is low on memory, it may struggle to run multiple apps simultaneously. Each app requires memory to store its data and execute its processes. If the available memory is limited, it can cause apps to crash. That happens because they don't have enough resources to operate properly.

### Software Compatibility

Android devices come in various models and run different operating system versions. That's why it is essential to use apps compatible with your device. Since there are a lot of Android variants, it is hard to optimize apps for all devices. An app not optimized for an Android version or device leads to crashes or malfunctions.

### Outdated Apps

Apps are regularly updated to introduce new features, fix bugs, and enhance performance. Using an outdated version of an app may cause instability or compatibility problems. Since the app is not optimized for the current version of Android, it can keep crashing.

### Network Problems

Some apps rely heavily on network connectivity to function properly. They need a stable and strong internet connection to perform all the functions. These apps can crash if there are network connectivity issues, such as a weak Wi-Fi or network outage. Unstable connections can disrupt data transmission, making the app's function challenging.

### App Bugs

Despite rigorous testing, apps can still have bugs or coding errors that lead to crashes. Bugs in apps can occur due to various reasons. It mostly relates to incorrect implementation of features or unexpected user interactions. App developers work to identify and fix these bugs, often releasing updates.

It is possible that the corrupted cache files are responsible for this error. Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:

1. Open “Settings” on your Nokia G22 and choose “Apps & Notifications”/”Apps”/”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).

![settings crashing - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg)

## Part 2: Clear the Android phone’s RAM and retry

As the next tip, we would like to suggest you clear your device’s RAM by ceasing the running apps in the background.

1. Firstly, you need to go to the Recent apps screen. For this, long-press the Home key.  
    Note: Please note that different devices have different ways to go to the Recent apps screen. Do it according to the Nokia G22 device you own.
2. Now, swipe the apps and tap on the clear option. You will be able to notice the amount of RAM cleared

![settings crashing - clear ram](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-ram.jpg)

## Part 3: Uninstall the Google update

Uninstalling Google Play Store updates has also responded well to many users. It has worked in the case of the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” error. So, we would also like to suggest you use this tip if the others don’t work. Here are the steps to be followed for this.

1. Open “Settings” on your Android and tap on “Application manager” or “Apps” or “Application.
2. Now, head to all the apps and select “Google Play Store” from there.
