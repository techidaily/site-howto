## Part 5. Check for the Android update

![snapchat stopping - check for android update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-update-firmware.png)

Similar to some of the other solutions we’ve listed above, if you’re using an outdated version of the Android operating system, but the latest version of Snapchat is coded to the most recent, this can be a cause for the Snapchat crashing on Android problem to occur.

Fortunately, it’s easy to check to make sure you’re running the latest version of Android and to download and install the update if you need it. Here’s how, which will help to sort out your Snapchat keeps crashing Android problems.

## Part 6. Connect to another Wi-Fi

In some cases, you may be trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network that’s not very stable. This may keep cutting the connection to your device, which in turn is causing Snapchat to crash on Android.

To resolve this, you can simply try connecting to another Wi-Fi network or a data plan to see whether this is the problem. If so, changing network and then using the Snapchat app should stop any error messages from occurring.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Motorola Moto G23, followed by the Wi-Fi option.

![snapchat stopping - connect to wifi](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-change1.png)

## Part 7. Stop using the custom ROM

![snapchat stopping - stop rom](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-custom-rom.jpg)

If you’re running a custom Android ROM on your device, with some versions of the ROM and some apps, you’re going to experience errors simply because of the way the apps and the ROMs are coded and designed.

Unfortunately, there’s no easy fix to this, and if you want to continue using the app, you’ll need to reflash your Motorola Moto G23 back to its original firmware, and then wait until the ROM developers update the ROM to be compatible with social apps like Snapchat.

However, this reflashing process is simple thanks to the Dr.Fone - System Repair (Android) software that we listed above. To follow the detailed step-by-step guide, follow the steps on Part 4 of this article, or follow the quick guide instructions below.

One of the last resorts you can take is factory resetting your Motorola Moto G23 back to its original settings. From the day you first started using your device, you’ve been using the system and downloading files and apps, and over time this increases the chances of creating a bug.

## Fixes for Apps Keep Crashing on Motorola Moto G23

The rapid evolution of technology has transformed our smartphones into powerful devices. Presently, with just a few taps, they possess the ability to accomplish a diverse array of tasks. It has been possible due to the extensive availability of mobile applications. However, it can be incredibly frustrating when your favorite apps keep crashing repeatedly.

You're not alone if you're an Android user who encounters app crashes. This article will explore ten practical ways to fix apps that keep crashing on Android devices. We will also discuss the causes behind app crashes and how to prevent them.

## Part 1: What Are the Causes Behind Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

There are many reasons for ****the app crashing**** on Android devices. These reasons range from insufficient storage space to bugs and glitches in the apps. Finding out the root cause of an app crashing is important so that you can find the appropriate solution. Discussed below are some of the reasons why your Android apps keep crashing:

### Insufficient Memory

When a device is low on memory, it may struggle to run multiple apps simultaneously. Each app requires memory to store its data and execute its processes. If the available memory is limited, it can cause apps to crash. That happens because they don't have enough resources to operate properly.

### Software Compatibility

Android devices come in various models and run different operating system versions. That's why it is essential to use apps compatible with your device. Since there are a lot of Android variants, it is hard to optimize apps for all devices. An app not optimized for an Android version or device leads to crashes or malfunctions.

### Outdated Apps

Apps are regularly updated to introduce new features, fix bugs, and enhance performance. Using an outdated version of an app may cause instability or compatibility problems. Since the app is not optimized for the current version of Android, it can keep crashing.

### Network Problems

Some apps rely heavily on network connectivity to function properly. They need a stable and strong internet connection to perform all the functions. These apps can crash if there are network connectivity issues, such as a weak Wi-Fi or network outage. Unstable connections can disrupt data transmission, making the app's function challenging.

### App Bugs

Despite rigorous testing, apps can still have bugs or coding errors that lead to crashes. Bugs in apps can occur due to various reasons. It mostly relates to incorrect implementation of features or unexpected user interactions. App developers work to identify and fix these bugs, often releasing updates.

## Part 2: How to Fix the Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

Once you discover why your Android apps keep crashing, fixing them becomes a lot easier. However, there is no need to worry even if you cannot locate the problem source. Below we have listed 10 general and specialized solutions to ****fix app crashing****:
