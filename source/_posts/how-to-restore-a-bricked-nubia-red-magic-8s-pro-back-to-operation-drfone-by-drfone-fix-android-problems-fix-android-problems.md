## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

Below are the common causes why a **cell phone bricks**.

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device's OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. [Rooting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html) often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone's core functionality.

#### Installing Bad Apps

Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation. In severe cases, they can trigger a [boot loop](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/boot-loop-android.html) or render the phone unresponsive.

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.

The Easy Mode removes those features that confuse the users by messing up the screen. Hence, we suggest you to switch to this mode in order to remove “**_TouchWiz not working_**” problem. The steps are:

- Open “Settings” and go to “Personalization”.
- Hit on “Easy Mode” now.

Hope the **_TouchWiz won’t keep stopping_** error does not pop up anymore!

### Boot your phone to safe mode

Here is the next solution to be followed when TouchWiz keeps stopping. As we already said, third-party apps can cause this issue, booting your device in the Safe mode will disable those apps temporarily. Hence you need to boot your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro device to Safe mode and check if the reason is any third-party app.

- Switch off your device to initiate.
- Press “Power” button and keep doing this until device’s logo appears on the screen.
- When you see logo appearing, instantly release the button and start holding “Volume Down” button.
- Keep holding until rebooting finishes.
- You will now witness “Safe mode” on the bottom screen. You can now release the button.

### Reset Factory settings

If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.

Along with this, we would also suggest you go take backup of your data so that you won’t lose any of the personal information from your device after performing factory reset. For your convenience, we have stated the backup steps too in the following guide. Have a look:

- Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup & Reset”.
- Notice if “Back up my data” is enabled or not. If not, turn it on and create backup.
- Now, scroll for “Factory Data reset” option and confirm it by clicking “Reset Phone”.

- Wait a few minutes and your device will reboot.

### Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz

We believe that you will find the above methods helpful. However, if still in case your **_TouchWiz is not working_**, we advice you that you should install a new theme launcher in your device. It will be a wise option to ditch TouchWiz in such scenario rather than tolerating the problem. Hope this advice will help you.
