## Part 1: Understanding Bricked Honor X7b

Have you ever heard the term "bricked" concerning your Honor X7b device? This section explains it to you in simple terms. Imagine your device becoming like a brick, unresponsive and seemingly lifeless. That's what happens when a **Honor X7b gets bricked**. There are two main types of brick: soft brick and hard brick.
