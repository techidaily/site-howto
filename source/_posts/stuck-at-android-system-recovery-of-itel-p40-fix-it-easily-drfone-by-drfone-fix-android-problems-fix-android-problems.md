## Part 5. Check for the Android update

![snapchat stopping - check for android update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-update-firmware.png)

Similar to some of the other solutions we’ve listed above, if you’re using an outdated version of the Android operating system, but the latest version of Snapchat is coded to the most recent, this can be a cause for the Snapchat crashing on Android problem to occur.

In some cases, you may be trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network that’s not very stable. This may keep cutting the connection to your device, which in turn is causing Snapchat to crash on Android.

To resolve this, you can simply try connecting to another Wi-Fi network or a data plan to see whether this is the problem. If so, changing network and then using the Snapchat app should stop any error messages from occurring.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Itel P40, followed by the Wi-Fi option.

## Part 7. Stop using the custom ROM

![snapchat stopping - stop rom](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-custom-rom.jpg)

If you’re running a custom Android ROM on your device, with some versions of the ROM and some apps, you’re going to experience errors simply because of the way the apps and the ROMs are coded and designed.

Unfortunately, there’s no easy fix to this, and if you want to continue using the app, you’ll need to reflash your Itel P40 back to its original firmware, and then wait until the ROM developers update the ROM to be compatible with social apps like Snapchat.

However, this reflashing process is simple thanks to the Dr.Fone - System Repair (Android) software that we listed above. To follow the detailed step-by-step guide, follow the steps on Part 4 of this article, or follow the quick guide instructions below.

## Part 8. Reset the factory settings of your Android

![snapchat stopping - factory resetting](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-factory-reset.jpg)

One of the last resorts you can take is factory resetting your Itel P40 back to its original settings. From the day you first started using your device, you’ve been using the system and downloading files and apps, and over time this increases the chances of creating a bug.

However, by resetting your device to factory settings, you can reset these bugs and get your apps and device working again free from the Unfortunately, Snapchat has stopped error message. Here’s how to factory reset your device.

Make sure you back up your personal files from your device first like your photos and music files because factory resetting your device will clear your device’s memory.

**Step 1:** Tap the Settings menu on your device and click the Backup and Reset option.

**Step 2:** Click the Reset Phone option. That’s it! The phone will take several minutes to complete the process, after which your phone will be reset to its original state.

Step 1 - Go to the application that you got the error with.

Step 2 - Open that application download page on the Play store.

Step 3 - Uninstall it or even uninstall all the update (If the error came when you were updating the application).

Step 4 - Now you clear the task manager and try installing it once again. If the play store error 920 doesn’t come then you have solved the problem and now wasn’t that easy. So it’s always best to try this step before doing anything else.

![error code 920-install apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022232651.jpg)

#### **METHOD 3: Switching off and turning the wifi (cellular data) on**

This is another basic method in solving the play store error 920. This error comes in when you have given too many tasks to download.

Step 1 - To remove that load Just turn your wifi off and then turn your wifi on (the same goes with your cellular data).

Step 2 - Now after doing this go to your Play Store application and download the application that you were going to download. Now your Play Store Error 920 won’t be bothering you anymore.

![error code 920-turn off wifi](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022435219.jpg)

#### **METHOD 4: Clearing the cache and data of Google Play Store**

This is a little more complicated (complicated as in you will need to do a little more than the previous two methods). What you need to do is clear the cache and clear the data of the play store. This will get rid of the error code 920 the next time you download or update any application from the Google Play store.

Step 1 – Go to settings of your device.

Step 2 – Now find “Applications” option under the settings menu. Here you can find “Google Play Store” option. Open it.

Step 3 – Now, at the bottom, you can find “Clear Cache” option. Tap on it and your all cache will be cleared.

![error code 920-google play store clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022644620.jpg)

After doing this step clear your task manager (delete all recent applications). Go to play store and resume your download or update.

#### **METHOD 5: Removing and adding back your Google account**

It is best if you follow the order of the methods mentioned. Like, try each method in the given order until you get rid of the play store error 920. If you reach here then you truly must be in a desperate position to get rid of this error. The best and guaranteed way is to delete your Google account from your phone. By deleting what is meant here is to temporarily remove your account and the adding it in again. What this does is it kind of resets your play store details and it eradicates the error code 920. To do this you need to

Step 1 - go to Settings of your Mobile.

Step 2- Now, find “Accounts” and then go to “Google Accounts”.
