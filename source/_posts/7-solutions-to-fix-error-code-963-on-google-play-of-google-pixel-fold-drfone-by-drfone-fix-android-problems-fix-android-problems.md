Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Google Pixel Fold touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Google Pixel Fold phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen.
