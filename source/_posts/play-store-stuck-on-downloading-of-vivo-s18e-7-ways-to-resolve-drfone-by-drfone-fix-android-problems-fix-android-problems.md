![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Vivo S18e needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Vivo S18e. Here’s how to check on your Vivo S18e to make sure everything is correct.
