Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page.

If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Vivo X100 to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.

### 4. Wipe Cache Data

Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Vivo X100 device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Vivo X100 to become slower and eventually get stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

Wiping out the cache data from your Vivo X100 could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.

However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset.
