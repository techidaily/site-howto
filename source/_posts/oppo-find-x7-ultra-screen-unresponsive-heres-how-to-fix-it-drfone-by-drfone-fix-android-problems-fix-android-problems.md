## What Causes A Oppo Find X7 Ultra Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Oppo Find X7 Ultra phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Oppo Find X7 Ultra screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Oppo Find X7 Ultra Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Oppo Find X7 Ultra screens to become unresponsive.

These issues can also occur in any Oppo Find X7 Ultra model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Oppo Find X7 Ultra Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Oppo Find X7 Ultra Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Oppo Find X7 Ultra screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Oppo Find X7 Ultra black screen problem.
