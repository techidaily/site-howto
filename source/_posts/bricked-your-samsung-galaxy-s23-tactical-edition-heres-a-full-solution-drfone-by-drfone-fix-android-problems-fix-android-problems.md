### 2. Pull Out Battery

Another way to restart your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page.

If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.
