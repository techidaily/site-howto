## Why Is My Itel A70 Offline? Troubleshooting Guide

Ever had your Itel A70 claim it's offline, leaving you scratching your head about where it went wrong? We get it; it's confusing. That's why this article is here to untangle the mystery.

In the following sections, we're diving into the **"why is My Itel A70 offline"** dilemma that many Android users face. We'll break down the possible reasons behind this common issue and guide you through simple steps on how to fix it. By the end of the article, you’ll be able to get back to smooth internet surfing on your Itel A70. Let’s get started.

## Part 1: Why Does My Itel A70 Say Offline?

When you encounter the “offline” error message, it can disrupt your usual smartphone activities. Suddenly, you find yourself unable to browse the internet, send or receive emails, or stay connected through instant messages.

It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Itel A70 showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Itel A70. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

2. **Internet connection issues**

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My Itel A70 offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.

3. **Glitches or bugs**

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Itel A70 can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

4. **Firewall restrictions**

In some cases, a firewall on your Itel A70 might be overly restrictive, preventing the Itel A70 device from establishing a connection to the internet. This security measure, intended to protect your device, can sometimes go overboard and disrupt normal online functionality.

Now, you have understood the potential causes as the first step toward resolving the issue. Next, we'll guide you through the process of troubleshooting and getting your Itel A70 back online.

## Part 2: How To Fix “Phone Offline” With Internet Connection Problem

Now that we've figured out why your phone says it's offline, let's tackle the issue head-on. If you're facing problems like downloads that won't start, Google Play stuck on "Loading…," or web pages refusing to load, chances are it's an internet connection issue causing the problem.

Here are some easy solutions to get your connection back.

### Solution 1: Change connection to mobile data

Switching to mobile data can be a quick fix if your Wi-Fi is acting up. It ensures a change in your connection source and might resolve the "Phone offline" issue. Follow these easy steps to change your connection to mobile data:

![Change connection to mobile data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/why-is-my-phone-offline-2.jpg)

### Solution 2: On and off Airplane mode

[<u>Airplane Mode</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location.html) can sometimes cause connectivity confusion. Turning it off and on essentially resets your phone's wireless connections, which might resolve the offline issue.

How to on and off Airplane mode on Android:

- **Step 1:** Swipe down from the top of your screen to access the Quick Settings menu.
- **Step 2:** Look for the Airplane Mode icon and tap the icon to turn on Airplane Mode.

![On and off the Airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/why-is-my-phone-offline-3.jpg)

### Solution 3: Reset network settings

Resetting network settings can help eliminate any configuration glitches that might be causing the phone offline problem. It's like giving your phone's connection settings a fresh start.

To reset your network settings, the steps may differ depending on the phone model you are using. However, you can generally do so by looking for the “Network” settings.

- **Step 1:** Open your phone's Settings > Connection & sharing.
- **Step 2:** Find and select "Reset Wi-Fi, mobile networks, and Bluetooth.”
- **Step 3:** Tap "Reset Settings" and confirm the action and allow your phone to reset.

![Reset the network settings on Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/why-is-my-phone-offline-4.jpg)

### Solution 4: Restart your Wi-Fi router

Sometimes, the problem might not be with your phone but rather with the [<u>Wi-Fi router</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/root/wifi-hacker-without-root.html). Restarting it can refresh the connection and potentially resolve the connectivity problem.

How to restart your Wi-Fi router:

- **Step 1:** Locate your Wi-Fi router.
- **Step 2:** Turn off the router using the power button or unplug it.
- **Step 3:** Wait for about 10–15 seconds before plugging the router back in or turning it on.

These solutions should cover the most common connectivity issues. If the problem persists, we'll explore further steps in the following sections.

## Part 3: How To Fix “Phone Offline” Despite Having an Internet Connection

In this part, we'll answer the question “**Why does My Itel A70 say offline android?**” despite a seemingly functional internet connection. Then, let's see other solutions on how to get your device back to its online, fully functional self.

### Solution 1: Clear Google Chrome’s cache and data

### Solution 2: Re-install Google Chrome

If [<u>clearing the cache and data</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/erase-iphone/clear-iphone-cache.html) didn't solve the offline issue, reinstalling Google Chrome can be the next step.
