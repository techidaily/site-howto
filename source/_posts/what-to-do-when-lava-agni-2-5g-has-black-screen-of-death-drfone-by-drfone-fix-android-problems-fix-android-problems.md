This can happen to various models, such as the Lava Agni 2 5G, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Lava Agni 2 5G device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Lava Agni 2 5G F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Lava Agni 2 5G device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Lava Agni 2 5G Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Lava Agni 2 5G device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Lava Agni 2 5G device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
