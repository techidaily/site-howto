To try fixing an Android Phone that won’t turn on, follow these steps:

1. For any Android devices, remove the battery (considering the battery of your Tecno Phantom V Fold can be removed) and leave it out for at least 30 minutes. Put back the battery in and try to turn it on.
2. Press and hold down the **Power** and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time for 15-30 minutes to reboot the Tecno Phantom V Fold device.
3. Should the first two steps do not work, charge your Tecno Phantom V Fold to get it out of the start-up loop. You can also opt to use a different battery, just in case your current battery is the source of the problem.
4. If there are any connected hardware e.g. SD card, remove them from the Tecno Phantom V Fold device.
5. Start your Tecno Phantom V Fold in **Safe Mode** by pressing and holding down the **Menu** or **Volume Down** button on your device.
6. Should the first five steps do not work for you, perform a hard reset. Do take note that each device will have a different way to do so and that data that is stored locally on the phone will be deleted.
7. Send your Tecno Phantom V Fold to the repair shop should none of these steps work.
