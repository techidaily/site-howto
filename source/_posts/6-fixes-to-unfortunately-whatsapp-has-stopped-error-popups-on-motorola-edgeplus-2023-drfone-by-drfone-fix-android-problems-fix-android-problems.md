Insufficient storage could be the other reason why for your WhatsApp has stopped. When your device starts running out of space, some apps may not be able to operate properly for their functions take up space in the Motorola Edge+ (2023) device. And probably WhatsApp is one of them. If the space is the case with you, we suggest you the following two things to go with.

- Secondly, start eliminating the apps that are no longer needed. This will indeed create more space in your device and will let your WhatsApp wok properly.

If this is the case, we suggest you to log out and log in with some another Gmail account.

- Log out by opening “Settings” and tap on “Accounts”.
- Choose your Google account and tap on “REMOVE ACCOUNT”.
