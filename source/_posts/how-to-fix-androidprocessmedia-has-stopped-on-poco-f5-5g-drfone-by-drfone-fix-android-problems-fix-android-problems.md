With a full backup of your Poco F5 5G, you can now embark on a mission to fix the error. There are several methods to clear this error. We have outlined three of the most effective solutions here.

Step 2: Access "Apps."

Step 3: Tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner and select "Reset App Preferences."

### Method 3: Clear the cache and data on your device
