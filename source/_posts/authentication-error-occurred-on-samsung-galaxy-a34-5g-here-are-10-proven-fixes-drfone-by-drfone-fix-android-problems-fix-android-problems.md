## Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot

Sometimes, people complain that Samsung Galaxy A34 5G is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.
