The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.

## Part 4: Update software to the latest version to fix Android phone keeps turning off

Software glitches or outdated operating systems can trigger automatic shutdowns on Android phones. Updating your Infinix Smart 7's software version can be an effective solution to fix the issue of the phone repeatedly turning off. Regular software updates provided by the phone manufacturer often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches. These updates can address underlying problems that may be causing the random shutdowns, ensuring a more stable and reliable phone performance.

To update the software on your Infinix Smart 7, follow these steps:

Go to "Settings" on your Infinix Smart 7 and navigate to the "System" or "Software Update" section (the exact wording may vary depending on your device model and Android version). Look for the option to "Check for updates" to see if any new software updates are available.

## Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off

When a phone overheats, it can trigger an automatic shutdown as a protective mechanism to prevent damage to the Infinix Smart 7 device's internal components. Overheating occurs when the phone's internal temperature rises significantly, typically due to excessive heat generated by the processor and other hardware components during intensive tasks or prolonged usage.

To prevent the phone from turning off due to overheating, you can take various measures, such as limiting intensive usage, avoiding direct sunlight and hot environments, and using the phone on hard surfaces to aid heat dissipation.

## Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode

Starting your phone in Safe Mode is a good way to narrow down whether or not the problem is occurring because of some heavy and incompatible Apps as Safe Mode allows only built-in Apps to function. If you can use your phone in Safe Mode, consider deleting the unnecessary Apps which may be burdening the phone’s processor.

To boot into Safe Mode:

Long press the power button to see the following options on the screen.
