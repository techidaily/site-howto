## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

Below are the common causes why a **cell phone bricks**.

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Asus ROG Phone 7 device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Asus ROG Phone 7 device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device's OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. [Rooting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html) often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone's core functionality.

#### Installing Bad Apps

Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation. In severe cases, they can trigger a [boot loop](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/boot-loop-android.html) or render the phone unresponsive.

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.

## Part 2. Unbricking Methods and Tools

Below are solutions that you can employ to fix various brick phone scenarios.
