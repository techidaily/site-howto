## OnePlus Open Screen Unresponsive? Here's How to Fix It

OnePlus Open phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **OnePlus Open touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for OnePlus Open phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **OnePlus Open touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A OnePlus Open Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a OnePlus Open phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of OnePlus Open screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some OnePlus Open Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the OnePlus Open device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause OnePlus Open screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any OnePlus Open model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, OnePlus Open Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A OnePlus Open Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of OnePlus Open screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue.

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the OnePlus Open black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

After fully discharging the battery, the OnePlus Open device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service
