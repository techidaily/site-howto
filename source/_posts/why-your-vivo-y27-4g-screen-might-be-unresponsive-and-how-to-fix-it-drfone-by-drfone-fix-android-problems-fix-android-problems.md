This can happen to various models, such as the Vivo Y27 4G, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Dropping or impacting an Vivo Y27 4G device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Vivo Y27 4G Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Vivo Y27 4G device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Vivo Y27 4G device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
