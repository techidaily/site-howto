- **Step 1:** Open Chrome on your Itel A60s and type “chrome://flags” in the address bar.

![chrome experimental flags](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-07.jpg)

Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots

You can download several applications on Google Play Store if you still can’t take a screenshot due to security policy. Some popular third-party screenshot apps include:

- Screenshot Easy

- Screen Master: Screenshot Markup

Third-party screenshot apps often use different methods to capture the screen. These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.

This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.

Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions

Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.
