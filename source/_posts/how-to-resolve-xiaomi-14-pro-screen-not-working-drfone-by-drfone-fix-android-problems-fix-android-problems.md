In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Xiaomi 14 Pro device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Xiaomi 14 Pro device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

Another way to avoid Xiaomi 14 Pro Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Xiaomi 14 Pro device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness.
