Every service on your Honor Magic 5 Pro using a feature called a cache. This is where information is stored to help the feature run properly and give you the best experience. However, over time this can get messy and can cause problems with your Bluetooth feature.

By clearing the cache, you can restart the service and hopefully clear up any issues or problems you may be experiencing.

2. Select the Storage option

Sometimes, you may have a problem with the Honor Magic 5 Pro device you’re trying to connect to via Bluetooth, especially if this is a device you’ve updated. To counter and repair this, you’re going to need to remove the paired devices saved with your device and then reconnect them.

Here’s how;

1. From the Main Menu of your Honor Magic 5 Pro, head to Settings > Bluetooth > Connected Devices.
2. Turn Bluetooth on, and you’ll see all the connections your Honor Magic 5 Pro is paired with
3. Go through these settings and remove/delete/forget every connection on your device
4. Now when you go to connect to a device using Bluetooth, repair the Honor Magic 5 Pro device, enter the passcode, and use a fresh paired connection.

### 2.5 Use Bluetooth in safe mode

![android bluetooth problems - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-safemode.jpg)

If you’re having problems with your connection and paired devices, sometimes you may have conflicting software faults in your device that are causing the problems. If this is the case, you’ll need to boot your Honor Magic 5 Pro in Safe Mode.

This is an operating state in which your phone will run the bare minimum services it needs to perform. If your Bluetooth works in Safe Mode, you know you have an app or a service that’s causing the problem.

Here’s how to find out;

1. Hold the power button down, so the Android power menu turns on
2. Long-press the power button again and the restart in Safe Mode option will come up
3. The phone will automatically boot into Safe Mode
4. Wait a minute on the Main Menu
5. Now turn on your Bluetooth and connect it to your preferred device

### 2.6 Turn on the discoverable feature

![android bluetooth problems - discoverable feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-discoverable.jpg)

To ensure your Bluetooth can connect to other devices, it’s important to make sure you’re making your device discoverable to other Bluetooth devices. If it’s hidden, other devices won’t be able to find it, and sometimes it can bug and prevent connections.

Here’s how to turn on your Bluetooth discoverable feature;

1. From the home screen of your Android, navigate to the Menu> Settings > Bluetooth
2. Toggle the Bluetooth switch, so it’s on
3. Under the available settings, tick the box that allows your Bluetooth device to be discoverable
4. Turn your Bluetooth feature on and connect to the Honor Magic 5 Pro device you’re trying to connect too

### 2.7 Exclude Bluetooth issues of the other device

![android bluetooth problems - exclude Bluetooth issues of others](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-newphone.jpeg)

Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your Honor Magic 5 Pro, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

1. Disconnect your Honor Magic 5 Pro from the Bluetooth device and turn your Bluetooth off
2. Now take another Bluetooth device and connect this to the Honor Magic 5 Pro device you’re trying to connect too. This could be another Android device, or even a computer or iOS device
3. If the new device doesn’t connect to your Bluetooth device, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Bluetooth device, not your Honor Magic 5 Pro
4. If the Honor Magic 5 Pro devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Honor Magic 5 Pro

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the Honor Magic 5 Pro devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Honor Magic 5 Pro to the Honor Magic 5 Pro device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.
