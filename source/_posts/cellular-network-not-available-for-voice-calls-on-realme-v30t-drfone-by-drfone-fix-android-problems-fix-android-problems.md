## Part 1. Preliminary Reasons For Cellular Network Not Available For Voice Calls

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

### 3\. Network Congestion

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the Realme V30T device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.

### 5\. Battery or Power Issues

In some instances, [<u>insufficient battery power</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-your-phone-battery-health.html) or power-saving modes on devices can cause this issue. They affect the Realme V30T device's capacity to sustain a consistent connection with the cellular network. This consequently causes voice call unavailability.

## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

Below are the common causes why a **cell phone bricks**.

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Realme V30T device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Realme V30T device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device's OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. [Rooting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html) often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone's core functionality.

#### Installing Bad Apps

Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation. In severe cases, they can trigger a [boot loop](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/boot-loop-android.html) or render the phone unresponsive.

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.

## Part 2. Unbricking Methods and Tools

Below are solutions that you can employ to fix various brick phone scenarios.

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue.

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.

![spotify server up or down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-21.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Go to one or two and see what they say. If Spotify is down, you’ll need to wait for them to fix the problem.

### 11. Clear the Cache

When using different apps and websites, your device caches data from those sources. Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

![settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-22.jpg)
