This can happen to various models, such as the Samsung Galaxy S24+, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Samsung Galaxy S24+ device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Samsung Galaxy S24+ F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Protecting the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
