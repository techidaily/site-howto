## How to Fix the Soft Bricked OnePlus Nord 3 5G?

Bricked phone is a serious problem, as your brick smartphone could be suffering from a soft brick or hard brick problem, and must be dealt with carefully. It is very common to see a brick smartphone these days. If you are wondering what exactly is a bricked phone, here is your answer.

A bricked phone, hard brick or soft brick, is a smartphone which refuses to start or boot all the way up the home/main screen of the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device. This issue is observed within most Android phones because users have a tendency to tamper with the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device settings, flashing new and customized ROMs and tweaking with the essential files. Playing around with the phone’s internal set-up leads to such errors, worst of them being a brick smartphone. Usually, a bricked phone does not switch on and stays frozen at the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device logo, a blank screen or even worse, doesn't respond to any command, even the power on command.

If you are confused about the soft brick and hard brick problems and looking for solutions to fix your priced phone, then here is all you need to know.

Read on to find out more.

## Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?

To begin with, let us understand the basic difference between a soft brick and hard brick issue. Both versions of a bricked phone prevent it from booting but differ in their causes and gravity of the problem.

A soft-brick problem is caused merely by a software error/crash and makes your device switch on automatically every time you manually turn it off. This phenomenon is referred to as Boot Loop. Soft bricked Android phones are not as difficult to fix as the hard bricked Android phones. It is convenient to say that a soft bricked phone only boots up half-way and not fully, whereas a hard bricked device does not switch on at all. A hard brick error is thus caused when the kernel, which is nothing but an interface for the software to communicate with the hardware, is tampered with. A hard bricked phone is not recognized by your PC when plugged in and is a serious problem. It requires troubleshooting techniques and cannot be easily fixed as the soft brick problem.

![hard bricked v/s soft bricked ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987188976168.jpeg)

Hard bricked phones are a rare sight, but the soft brick is very common. Given below are ways to fix a soft brick Android phone.

Stuck at boot loop problem can be fixed by clearing your Cache partitions. These partitions are nothing but storage locations for your modem, kernels, system files, drivers and built-in Apps data.

It is advisable to clear Cache partitions regularly to keep your phone free from such glitches.

Since the phone refuses to boot, Cache can be cleared from entering into the Recovery Mode. Different Android devices have different ways to put it in recovery mode. Normally pressing the power key and volume down key helps, but you may refer to your phone’s guide for better understanding and then follow the steps given below to clear the cache partition:

Once you are the recovery mode screen, you will see a number of options as shown in the screenshot.
