This article will share the possible reasons why your ****phone is stuck on the boot screen****. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!

It is not uncommon for **phones** to be ****stuck on the startup screen****, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.

### Physical Damage to the Phone

If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your ****phone being stuck on the boot screen****.

If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your ****phone getting stuck on the logo.****

### Liquid Damage

It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.

Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your ****phone stuck on the boot screen****. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.

For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.

### Software Issues

Software issues are probably the most common reason your ****phone is stuck on the logo**** screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.

The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the ****phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.**** Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.

## Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen

After understanding the common problems on why your phone is ****stuck on the startup screen**** page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.

### Hard reboot your phone

To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting ****stuck on the startup screen**** page.

Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Motorola G24 Power. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.

![hard reboot of samsung](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg)

### Put your phone in recovery mode

If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.

Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Motorola G24 Power or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.

****Step 1****: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Motorola G24 Power/Redmi phone

****Step 3****: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.

### Factory Reset

If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your **phone being stuck on the startup screen** through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.

Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.

****Step 1****: Open the **Settings** application on your phone and **tap General Management**.

## Calls on Motorola G24 Power Go Straight to Voicemail? 12 Fixes

Have you ever experienced incoming calls to your **phone go straight to voicemail** without ringing? It can be frustrating, especially if you’re expecting an important call.

In most cases, incoming calls going to voicemail without ringing are common. However, if it’s happening frequently or for all calls, your phone may have a problem.

This article will discuss why incoming **phone calls go straight to voicemail** and how to fix the problem.

![phone voicemail notification representation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Not Ringing? Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail

If an incoming call to your **cell phone goes straight to voicemail** without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:

1. Turn Off Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode

DND mode is a feature that silences all incoming calls, notifications, and alerts. If DND mode is enabled, your **cell phone goes straight to voicemail** when someone calls. To turn off DND mode, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification settings panel, then tap the **Do not disturb** icon.

![do not disturb mode not enabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-02.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Toggle **Do Not Disturb** offto disable the mode.

2. Turn Off Call Forwarding

One reason calls go **straight to voicemail without ringing** is if you enabled call forwarding. Call forwarding is a feature that redirects incoming calls to another number. To turn off call forwarding:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone Dialer** app on your device, then tap the **menu** icon and select **Settings**.

![phone dial app settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-04.jpg)

![call settings supplementary services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-05.jpg)

3. Disable Call Barring

If a phone **call went straight to voicemail**, another possible explanation is the call barring. It is a feature that restricts calls from being made or received on your phone. If activated, it can cause incoming calls to a phone to go straight to voicemail. To turn off call barring on Motorola G24 Power devices:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone Dialer** app, then tap the **menu** icon in the top right corner.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Settings** > **Supplementary services** > **Call barring**, then tap **OK**.
- **Step 3:** Select **Voice call**, then turn off your preferred outgoing and incoming calls. When prompted, enter 0000 as a password.

![call barring settings interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-06.jpg)

4. Update Your Phone’s Software

Sometimes, software bugs can cause problems with incoming calls, which may be why your last incoming **call went straight to voicemail**. If your phone runs outdated software, try updating it to the latest version.

To check for updates, open the **Settings** app and go to **Software update** or **System update**. For a seamless update experience, follow the step-by-step instructions on your mobile screen.

![software update settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-07.jpg)

5. Reset Network Settings

If the incoming calls on your **phone go straight to voicemail**, consider resetting your phone’s network settings. Network settings control how your phone connects to the cellular network. If these settings are not set up correctly, incoming calls may not be able to reach your device.

**Note:** Resetting your network settings will erase any saved Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth pairings, requiring you to re-enter them after the reset is complete.

To reset your network settings on most Android devices:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your smartphone, then tap **System** or **General Management**.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Reset** > **Reset Network Settings** and confirm the action.

![phone reset network settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-08.jpg)

6. Turn Off Bluetooth

When Bluetooth is on, it can interfere with your device’s ability to receive calls, causing them to go **straight to voicemail without ringing**. To turn off [<u> Bluetooth</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-16/fix-wifi-bluetooth-issues-after-upgrading-ios-16.html) on an Android device, you can do one of the following:

![turn off bluetooth on settings app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-10.jpg)

It should help ensure that calls come through to your phone instead of going to voicemail.

7. Check Airplane Mode

If turning off Bluetooth didn’t solve the issue, another possible cause could be that your phone is in Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode turns off all wireless connections on your phone, including cellular service, which can cause calls to **dial straight to voicemail**. There are two ways to turn off Airplane mode on Android:

Using the Settings app:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app.
- **Step 2:** Tap **Network & internet**.
- **Step 3:** Toggle off **Airplane mode** or **Flight mode**.

8. Check Blocked Numbers

**“My boyfriend’s phone goes straight to voicemail** when someone is calling. Any idea why that might be?”

Do you also find yourself asking what does it mean? It could be that he has blocked that phone number. To check this:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone dialer** app.
- **Step 2:** Tap the **menu** icon in the top right corner and select **Settings**.
- **Step 3:** Tap **Block numbers**. If you find the number in the blocked list, remove it to ensure that their calls come through to the phone.

![block numbers on the phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-12.jpg)

If you still have trouble reaching your boyfriend, try calling him from a different number. If your call didn’t go through, you know that he hasn’t blocked your number and that there may be another issue with his phone.

9. Turn Off Google One VPN

If you’re using Google One VPN, try turning it off to see if that fixes the problem. Some users have reported that Google One VPN can cause incoming calls to a **phone to go straight to voicemail**. To turn off Google One VPN:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Google One** app on your Motorola G24 Power.
- **Step 2:** At the bottom, go to the **Benefits** tab, then tap **View Details** below the **Online protection with a VPN** section.

![google one app interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-13.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Toggle off **Enable VPN**.

![turn off google one vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-14.jpg)

10. Contact Your Carrier

If your **phone calls go straight to voicemail** after trying all the above, contact your carrier for help. They may be able to troubleshoot the problem or determine if there is a service outage in your area.

And if your carrier confirms that there is no service outage or billing-related block, the problem may be with your phone itself. You may need to try resetting your phone to factory settings or taking it to a repair shop.

11. The Caller Used Ringless Voicemail

Ringless voicemail is a service that allows businesses to bypass your phone’s ringtone and send you pre-recorded messages directly to voicemail. Ringless voicemail is often used for marketing purposes. If you think you’re receiving ringless voicemail calls, you can contact the company calling you and ask them to remove you from their list.

This can happen to various models, such as the Motorola G24 Power, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Motorola G24 Power device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Motorola G24 Power F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Motorola G24 Power device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Motorola G24 Power Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Motorola G24 Power device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Motorola G24 Power device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Motorola G24 Power devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.
