![person holding their android with black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-1.jpg)

There’s a reason Android holds over two-thirds of the mobile operating system market share. It’s a powerful OS that gives you the utmost freedom and flexibility, allowing you to customize your phone to suit your needs.

However, regardless of the capabilities of Android phones and the features that come with their OS, just like any other smartphone, they’re prone to glitches and annoying issues – especially with their video files.

You may encounter **videos not playing on your Vivo S18 Pro** more frequently than you like. Whether it’s video files you’ve recorded using your phone or files you’ve downloaded, this glitch can get pretty annoying pretty fast. Fortunately, there are several solutions you could try to fix it.

See what you can do if **videos won’t play on your Android.**

## Why Are My Videos Not Playing On Android?

![person recording cityscape using their android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-2.jpg)

Considering how most smartphone manufacturers tend to emphasize the unbelievable quality of their cameras, perfect night modes, seamless slow-motion recordings, superb resolution, and more, you’d expect all images and videos to function flawlessly on your Android. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case.

Occasionally, you could find that the videos you access from your gallery won’t play, sending you the message that “video cannot be played” or “can’t play video.” Other times, you might find that YouTube videos won’t load correctly or your downloaded videos won’t open in your media player.

There could be a wide variety of reasons that is happening, including:

- Corrupted video
- Corrupted SD card
- Outdated media player
- Outdated OS
- Incomplete download from the source
- Low storage
- Video downloaded from a suspicious source

An array of hardware and software issues could lead to you being unable to play videos on your Android. However, that doesn’t mean you should immediately send your device for repairs or delete the videos that won’t play. There might be a few better solutions you could try.

## What You Can Do if Your Videos Aren’t Playing On Android Phone

Since there are many reasons for having problems with videos not playing on your Android, you could also try many solutions.

### 1. Do a Factory Reset

![person holding a black android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-3.jpg)

While a factory reset shouldn’t always be the first solution you go to, it can usually prove to be the most effective one.

A factory reset, aka a master reset or a hard reset, returns all your software configurations to the original state when the phone was first manufactured. In the process, all your data is lost – any photos and videos you have on your phone and the apps you’ve installed will be deleted. You’ll be logged out of all your accounts and won’t have access to your message history, contacts, and more.

While it seems like an extreme step, it can help fix any video issues you might encounter due to software bugs.

Though there could be slight variations between different phones, you can usually perform a factory reset by going to **Settings > General Management > Reset > Factory data reset > Reset.**

![factory reset on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-4.jpg)

### 2. Restart Your Vivo S18 Pro

While a factory reset is all but guaranteed to fix the issues you’re encountering with your videos, sometimes a simple restart might do the trick just fine. A restart works by clearing your RAM (Random Access Memory).

In a nutshell, RAM stores short-term data that helps your processor complete tasks quickly. This data is always easily accessible, and it’s what helps your phone quickly open webpages and apps you’ve recently used.

Over time, however, your RAM can get filled with unnecessary data and data fragments, which, in turn, can confuse your processor.

Restarting your phone will clear your RAM and potentially eliminate any data fragments causing your videos to be unplayable.

### 3. Check the Video Format

As a general rule of thumb, the videos you capture should be in a format your device supports. However, the videos you’ve downloaded might not be. That’s why checking the files’ video format before trying other possible fixes is in your best interest.

If the format isn’t supported, installing the right video player with the necessary compatibility is the most straightforward fix. Some of the most popular video players for Android include VLC for Android, GOM Player, MX Player, Bsplayer, and RealPlayer. You can easily find all of them in the Google Play Store.

### 4. Check the Internet Connection

![pull-down bar on android showing wifi is turned off](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-5.jpg)

If you’re having problems playing downloaded or online videos, check your internet connection to see if there’s an issue there. If your internet’s down, any downloaded videos might not have downloaded correctly, and any online videos that haven’t been loaded will not play.

Make sure that you turn the Airplane mode off and your Wi-Fi on. Check the connection and test your internet speed to see if everything works properly.

You might need a network reset if your phone can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network. The path might differ between Android devices, but you should be able to find the option for a network reset at the exact location of your factory reset. Go to **Settings > General Management > Reset > Reset Network settings > Reset settings**.

![android network reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-6.jpg)

### 5. Clear the Cache

The cache stores a copy of your most commonly used data, helping decrease loading time and improve your phone’s performance. However, too much cache data can take up too much space and cause data corruption, preventing you from accessing some of your apps.

On average, you should clear your phone’s cache every few months to ensure that everything runs smoothly. If you encounter issues with your videos not playing on Android, clearing the cache could be just the fix you need.

To clear the cache from your apps, you’ll want to go to **Settings > Apps.** From there, select the app you want to remove the cache from, scroll down to **Storage**, then choose **Clear Cache**.

![clear cache on android apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-7.jpg)

### 6. Update Android OS

An outdated Android OS is usually the culprit behind many bugs and glitches you may encounter on your phone. It can prevent you from playing video files, accessing apps, taking photos, and more. It can lead to data corruption and loss, expose you to malware and cyberattacks, and compromise phone performance.

Regularly updating your OS to its latest version is always in your best interest. It can solve the problem of your videos not playing and protect you and your sensitive data.

### 7. Repair Your Android OS

![person holding a phone with black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-8.jpg)

You might already have the latest version of Android OS, but that still doesn’t mean your OS is functioning as it should. Maybe your phone was interrupted while downloading or installing the new OS version. Maybe your phone had underlying OS issues, or you accidentally downloaded files you shouldn’t have. Whatever the case is, if your videos don’t play due to an OS problem, you’ll need to repair your OS.

### 9. Clear Cookies and Browsing Data

If online videos are causing problems, not your recorded or downloaded ones, you might be due for a quick cookie and browsing data clearing.

You’ll first need to launch your mobile browser to clear cookies and browsing data. If you’re using Google Chrome, the process is simple and streamlined.

### 10. Reinstall Video Apps

If you still have issues with videos not playing on your Vivo S18 Pro, you could try deleting and reinstalling your video apps.

### Option 2: Restart Your Vivo S18 Pro

This method may seem simple, but it can be the most effective solution to your problem. Here is how you restart most smartphones available in the market.

****Step 1:**** Press and hold down the ****power key**** on your Vivo S18 Pro until the ****power menu**** appears.

****Step 2:**** Select ****Restart**** on your phone's screen. It will initiate a reboot of your device.

**Tip:**

If your Vivo S18 Pro is unresponsive to the usual restart method because a ****part of the phone screen is not working****, try a forced restart by holding the ****power button**** for at least 10 seconds.

### Option 3: Check If Stuck Vivo S18 Pro Phone Only Appears in Specific Mobile Apps

If the previous method did not work, check if the ****stuck pixels on the phone**** only appear in specific mobile apps. Sometimes, stuck pixels may only show up when using particular apps, so identifying which app is causing the issue can help pinpoint the problem.

****Step 1:**** Put your smartphone in ****Safe Mode****.

**Note:**

Visit the help page for your device's manufacturer to learn how to activate and deactivate safe mode. Safe mode disables all downloaded programs momentarily.

![safe mode on the android screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-08.jpg)

****Step 2:**** Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the ****stuck pixel phone**** display. Next, turn off ****Safe Mode****.

****Step 3:**** To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.

### Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset

Consider a factory data reset if the previous options did not resolve your issue with stuck or dead pixels on the phone screen. This process will erase all data from your device, so remember to back up any important information before proceeding.

****Step 1:**** Open the ****Settings**** application.

**Step 2:** Choose ****System > Reset > Erase all data (factory reset) > Erase all data****.

![smartphone reset settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-09.jpg)

**Note:**

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

Aside from the methods and tools discussed for fixing ****dead pixels on phone screen****s and ****stuck pixels on the phone****, you may still have some questions regarding the issues. Whether you are dealing with a single stuck pixel or a cluster of dead pixels, this section aims to provide you with helpful insights.

### 1\. Can Dead Vivo S18 Pros Fix Themselves?

No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Vivo S18 Pros Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

### 3\. Why Are Dead Vivo S18 Pros Spreading on My Vivo S18 Pro?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Vivo S18 Pros Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Vivo S18 Pro devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.
