### 1\. Check hidden apps

How could the **Android phone icon be missing**? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons.

### 3\. Re-enable disabled app

**App icons can also disappear on the Android** home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them.

To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:

- **Step 1**. Open the Apps & Notifications on the Settings.
- **Step 2.** Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the **phone icon disappears on your Android.**
