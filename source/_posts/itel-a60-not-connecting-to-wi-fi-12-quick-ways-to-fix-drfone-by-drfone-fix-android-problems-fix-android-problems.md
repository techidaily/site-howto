Nowadays, it’s pretty much essential to have your Itel A60 or smartphone connected to the internet. Whether you’re watching videos, looking something up, or using any kind of app, you need the internet for these applications to function correctly.

This is why it can so annoying when it gets to a point where the internet connection isn’t working. However, the problem of a web page not loading correctly is just the tip of the iceberg.

There are plenty of problems you could experience, whether it’s the [Wi-Fi network keeps disconnecting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/why-does-my-phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi.html) on its own without any warning, perhaps a security issue where the passcode or IP address isn’t being registered properly, or even if the connection is just being super slow, even if there’s no reason too.

Luckily, despite there being so many problems out there, there are also many solutions. Today, we’re going to share with you the complete definitive guide to help you get your Itel A60 connected and free from problems and issues.

## Part 1: Restart your Itel A60

Begin by powering off your Itel A60 and unplugging your router. Wait for about a minute before plugging in the router and turning on your device. This simple reset can often restore stable connections and fix Android wifi not working.

![turn on airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android-1.jpg)

## Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings

The third step you’ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Itel A60. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.

However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.

1. Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights
2. While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem
3. Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again
4. Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area
5. Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Itel A60 is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data

## Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode

![wifi not working on android - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg)

If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Itel A60 itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.

The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Itel A60, but the basic process goes as follows;

1. Turn off your Itel A60 by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Itel A60 device is completely off
2. Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time
3. You will see the words ‘Safe Mode’ appear on your screen as the Itel A60 device loads
4. Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works

If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, you’ll know you have a problem with an app or service that’s running on your device. If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.

## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

If you’re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, you’ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Itel A60 itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.

You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.

1. If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Itel A60 device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection
2. If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Itel A60 is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there
3. Whichever method you’re using, try disconnecting your Itel A60 and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Itel A60 needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Itel A60. Here’s how to check on your Itel A60 to make sure everything is correct.

1. Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Itel A60
2. Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router
3. Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router
4. Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches

When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.

## Part 7. Fix Android system issues in one click

If none of the solutions above are working, this could indicate a real problem with the firmware and operating system of your Itel A60. Fortunately, a fast solution to get everything working again is to completely repair the software of your phone.

You can do this easily using powerful Android recovery software known as [Dr.Fone - System Repair (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-repair/).

## Part 8. Check the Wi-Fi connectivity on another phone

![android phone not connecting to wifi - connectivity on another phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

When experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, it’s worth noting the problem might not be with your phone, but rather the Wi-Fi network itself. This is why it’s important to make sure you check the connection on another device.

Of course, if you’re already using another phone on your Wi-Fi network, you know this isn’t the case. However, if you’re not sure, here’s what you need to do;

1. Get another Android or iOS phone or tablet
2. Open the Settings menu and connect to the Wi-Fi network you’re having problems with
3. Enter the password and connect to the network
4. Open a web browser on the phone and try loading a web page
5. If the page loads, you know the Wi-Fi network isn’t the problem
6. If the page doesn’t load, you know you’ve got a problem with your Wi-Fi network

## Part 9. Change the password of the Wi-Fi

![android phone not connecting to wifi - password settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-password.jpg)

Each Wi-Fi network router will give the opportunity to choose and change the password you have to let devices connect to your network. It’s important you try changing this because you never know if someone else has accessed your network and could be blocking your device. Here’s how it works;

1. Log onto your computer and open your Wi-Fi settings
2. Depending on the brand and method of your individual router, navigate to the Wi-Fi password settings menu
3. Change the password to something complicated using all available digits and characters
4. Save the password and restart the router to disconnect all devices
5. Now connect your Itel A60 to the router using the new password

## Part 10. Reset network settings on Android

![android phone not connecting to wifi - reset network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-network.jpg)

Just like the method above where you’ll be effectively resetting the network settings on your router, if this hasn’t worked, you’ll be able to reset the network settings on your Itel A60, hopefully removing the bugs and allowing you to connect.

Here’s how you can do this easily on your Itel A60;

1. From the home screen of your Itel A60, open the Settings menu
2. Tap the Backup & Reset option
3. Tap the Reset Network Settings option
4. Tap the Reset Network option
5. If you need to, enter the PIN number or passcode for the Android device, and the Itel A60 device will confirm the reset has taken place
6. Reconnect your Itel A60 to your Wi-Fi network for the changes to take effect

## Part 11. Clear partition cache in recovery mode

![wifi not working on android - clear partition](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-partitioncache.jpg)

As you continue to use your Itel A60, the partition cache will fill up with data your device needs and doesn’t need. However, by clearing your device’s partition cache, you can make clear up some space which should help your device have enough memory to connect to the internet.

1. Turn off your Itel A60
2. Turn it on by holding down the power button, volume button, and home button
3. When your phone vibrates, let go of the Power button, but continue to hold the volume button
4. When a menu is displayed, use the volume buttons to navigate the menu
5. Select the Android System Recovery option, followed by Wipe Cache Partition
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet

## Part 12. Reset factory settings

![wifi not working on android - factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-factory-reset.jpg)

If worse comes to worst, another option you have is to factory reset your Itel A60. As we’ve spoken about above, while using your phone from the day you started using it, your device will fill up with files and data which can become messy and causes bugs.

However, by factory resetting your device, you can start again from the factory default from which you first received it, ultimately clearing the bugs. Make sure you back up your device before proceeding because it will erase your personal files.

1. Open the Settings menu on your Itel A60
2. Navigate to System > Advanced > Reset Options
3. Tap the Reset phone option, and enter your PIN code if required
4. Tap Erase Everything
5. Wait for your phone to complete the process
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet

Encountering the frustrating "**your device isn’t compatible with this version Google Play**" error can be disruptive. That's why it is essential to go through the underlying reasons causing this compatibility issue:

### 1\. Outdated Operating System Firmware

One of the primary culprits behind the compatibility error is [<u>outdated OS firmware</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html). App developers release updates to keep up with the latest features and security patches. That's why an obsolete OS version on your device may render it incompatible with the newer app versions available on the Google Play Store.

### 2\. Insufficient Hardware Requirements

Each application has specific hardware prerequisites that your device needs to fulfill. In case your smartphone does not meet the required specifications, you won't be able to utilize the app. Thus, Google Play Store may restrict access to certain applications, citing compatibility issues.

### 3\. Corrupted Cache Files

Cache files are designed to enhance the speed and efficiency of app loading. Yet, they can sometimes become corrupt. When this occurs, it disrupts the app's normal operation. Clearing these corrupted cache files is often a crucial step.

In certain cases, app developers or Google Play itself may impose geographic restrictions. This could lead to compatibility issues if your device is located in an area where the app is restricted. Understanding the geographical availability of an app is vital in finding the root cause.

### 4\. Beta Versions and Unstable Releases

Engaging with beta versions or unstable releases of an app can result in compatibility issues. These versions are typically in the testing phase. That's why their compatibility with a wide range of devices may not be guaranteed. If you find yourself facing compatibility errors, it's worth checking if you are in a beta program.

This is mainly due to geographical restrictions that are often imposed by developers. It poses a hurdle for users eager to access a particular application. However, there is no need to worry, as this article will help you in resolving this issue. It will delve into effective strategies and solutions to ensure the unavailability of an app is no longer an obstacle.

## Part 1: Reasons Behind the App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Issue

Encountering the "**Google Play App Not Available in Your Country**" issue can feel like hitting a roadblock. This restriction hampers your ability to explore and use valuable apps. It can also disrupt the smooth functioning of your daily digital activities. Before going for solutions, it is crucial to understand the reasons causing this restriction in installing apps on smartphones:

### 1\. Regional Restrictions

One of the primary culprits behind this issue is the regional restrictions imposed by developers. Developers often roll out their apps gradually across different regions. It is done to adhere to legal and licensing requirements. This staggered release strategy ensures compliance with local laws. Moreover, it guarantees a smooth user experience tailored to specific geographical locations.

### 2\. Licensing and Legal Constraints

Licensing agreements and legal constraints play an important role when it comes to the accessibility of apps. Developers may encounter licensing issues. This can prevent them from offering their apps in certain regions. It is due to copyright, trademark, or other legal considerations. Navigating the complex web of international laws and agreements is a big hassle. It becomes a determining factor in the availability of apps on the Play Store.

### 3\. Localization Challenges

Apps are often designed with specific markets in mind. These incorporate language, cultural, and regulatory considerations to enhance user experience. The absence of proper localization can render an app incompatible with specific regions. It includes factors such as adapting the app for different languages, currencies, and cultural nuances. This can result in the app being excluded from the **Play Store app not available in your country.**

### 4\. Device and OS Compatibility

The compatibility between the app, the user's device, and its OS is another factor that contributes to this issue. Developers might restrict their app availability to certain devices or OS versions. It can restrict access for users whose devices or OS do not meet the app's requirements. This technical limitation adds another layer to the complexity of app availability.

### 5\. Political and Economic Factors

In some instances, political tensions or economic considerations can also be a factor. It may influence the accessibility of apps in certain countries. Geo-political factors, trade sanctions, or economic conditions can impact the distribution of apps. This leads developers to exclude specific regions from their app's availability.
