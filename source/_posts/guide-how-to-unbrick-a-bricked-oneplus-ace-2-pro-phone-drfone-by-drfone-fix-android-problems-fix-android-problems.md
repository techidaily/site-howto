## What Causes A OnePlus Ace 2 Pro Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a OnePlus Ace 2 Pro phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of OnePlus Ace 2 Pro screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some OnePlus Ace 2 Pro Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause OnePlus Ace 2 Pro screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any OnePlus Ace 2 Pro model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, OnePlus Ace 2 Pro Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A OnePlus Ace 2 Pro Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of OnePlus Ace 2 Pro screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro black screen problem.
