![black phone with android logo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Should We Know About Motorola Edge 40 Pro Android System WebView Crashes?

This year, the term "**Android WebView crash 2023**" has become a familiar and dreaded phrase. This issue has plagued Android users, causing app crashes, [freezing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-frozen/iphone-keeps-freezing.html), and frustration. But what exactly is Android WebView, and what triggers these apps to crash?

Android WebView is an integral component of Android apps, acting as the invisible engine that renders web content within these apps. It allows users to seamlessly browse websites, watch videos, and interact with web pages without switching to a separate browser. However, when WebView crashes, it disrupts this integrated experience, causing apps to malfunction.

Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing **Android WebView crash**. These include:

- **App Freezing**

One of the earliest signs of an **Motorola Edge 40 Pro Android System WebView crash** is the app freezing. The app may become unresponsive, refusing to respond to your taps or gestures.

- **Unexpected App Closures**

Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. **Motorola Edge 40 Pro Android System WebView crashing apps** can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.

- **Error Messages**

Error messages can also provide valuable clues about the impending crash. These messages may appear as pop-ups or be displayed within the app itself.

![webview crash google app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-02.jpg)

- **Slow Loading Times**

Slow loading times can also be a sign of an impending crash. If webpages within the app take unusually long to load or images and other content appear pixelated or distorted, it could be a sign that Motorola Edge 40 Pro Android System WebView is struggling to handle the workload.

But why does WebView crash Android smartphones? The answer involves several factors:

- **Updates and Compatibility Issues**

Updates are often intended to improve software stability and compatibility, but in some cases, they can introduce new bugs or compatibility issues that lead to crashes. It is particularly evident when app developers and WebView developers release updates that don't fully align, causing conflicts.

- **Insufficient Memory**

Motorola Edge 40 Pro Android System WebView requires a certain amount of memory to operate properly. If your device is running low on memory, it can cause Motorola Edge 40 Pro Android System WebView to crash. It is more likely to happen on older devices with less RAM.

![webview crash out of memory message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-03.jpg)

- **Outdated Motorola Edge 40 Pro Android System WebView**

The WebView app is responsible for rendering web content within Android apps. Using an outdated version of WebView can introduce known bugs and security vulnerabilities that can cause crashes.

- **Conflicts With Other Apps**

WebView might crash if it conflicts with other resources or processes running on the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device. It can happen if the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device runs low on memory or other resource-intensive apps compete for system resources.

In the next section, you'll explore potential solutions to keep your apps running smoothly.

![phone voicemail notification representation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Not Ringing? Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail

If an incoming call to your **cell phone goes straight to voicemail** without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:

![phone dial app settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-04.jpg)

![call settings supplementary services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-05.jpg)

3. Disable Call Barring

If a phone **call went straight to voicemail**, another possible explanation is the call barring. It is a feature that restricts calls from being made or received on your phone.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone Dialer** app, then tap the **menu** icon in the top right corner.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Settings** > **Supplementary services** > **Call barring**, then tap **OK**.

4. Update Your Phone’s Software

Sometimes, software bugs can cause problems with incoming calls, which may be why your last incoming **call went straight to voicemail**. If your phone runs outdated software, try updating it to the latest version.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your smartphone, then tap **System** or **General Management**.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Reset** > **Reset Network Settings** and confirm the action.

![phone reset network settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-08.jpg)

8. Check Blocked Numbers

**“My boyfriend’s phone goes straight to voicemail** when someone is calling. Any idea why that might be?”

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone dialer** app.
- **Step 2:** Tap the **menu** icon in the top right corner and select **Settings**.
- **Step 3:** Tap **Block numbers**. If you find the number in the blocked list, remove it to ensure that their calls come through to the phone.

If you still have trouble reaching your boyfriend, try calling him from a different number. If your call didn’t go through, you know that he hasn’t blocked your number and that there may be another issue with his phone.
