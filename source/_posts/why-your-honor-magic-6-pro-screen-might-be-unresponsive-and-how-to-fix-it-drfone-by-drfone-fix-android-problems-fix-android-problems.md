Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Honor Magic 6 Pro device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Honor Magic 6 Pro, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Honor Magic 6 Pro device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Honor Magic 6 Pro F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Honor Magic 6 Pro device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Honor Magic 6 Pro Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Honor Magic 6 Pro device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Honor Magic 6 Pro device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
