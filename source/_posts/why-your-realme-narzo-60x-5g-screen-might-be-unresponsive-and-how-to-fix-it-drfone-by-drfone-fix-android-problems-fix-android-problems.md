1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Realme Narzo 60x 5G showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Realme Narzo 60x 5G.

[<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

4. **Firewall restrictions**

In some cases, a firewall on your Realme Narzo 60x 5G might be overly restrictive, preventing the Realme Narzo 60x 5G device from establishing a connection to the internet. This security measure, intended to protect your device, can sometimes go overboard and disrupt normal online functionality.
