1. Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.

3. Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.

Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.

### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending.

### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your OnePlus Open in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.

### Clear Storage of Device

So, make sure you wipe out the items you no longer needed on your device and create some room so that the Gmail responds nicely and won’t be running slow anymore.

### Update Gmail App

As the last tip that will indeed help you is to update the Gmail app. Until you update the app when required, Gmail keeps stopping you from working and you will definitely get frustrated.
