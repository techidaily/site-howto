It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Honor Magic 6 Lite showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Honor Magic 6 Lite.
