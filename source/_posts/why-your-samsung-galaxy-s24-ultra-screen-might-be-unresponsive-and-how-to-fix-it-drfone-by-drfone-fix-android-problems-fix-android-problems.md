This can happen to various models, such as the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Below are some possible causes of Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot.

These issues can also occur in any Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Screen Unresponsive

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultralogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Leaving the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.
