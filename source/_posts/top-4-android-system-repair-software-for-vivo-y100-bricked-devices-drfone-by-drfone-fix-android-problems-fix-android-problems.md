The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Vivo Y100 device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Vivo Y100 smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Vivo Y100 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

### **There might be issues with the Vivo Y100 device itself**

Screens on Vivo Y100 devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every Vivo Y100 device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.

### **There might be errors in the updated software**

The Android operating system is adjustable. Some of our technological advancements may backfire on us. The phone won't power on or become stuck in a boot loop where the logo will only show intermittently. For example, some Vivo Y100 4 and 5 users have reported their screens are unresponsive after a software update, rendering the Vivo Y100 device unusable.
