## Reliable User Guide to Fix Huawei P60 Running Slow and Freezing

Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.

However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the **Android phone is running slow and freezing** over time. There can be many potential reasons why **Android phone runs slow** suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.

In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Huawei P60 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Huawei P60 device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Huawei P60 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Huawei P60 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Huawei P60 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Huawei P60 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Huawei P60 is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Huawei P60 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Huawei P60s.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Huawei P60 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Huawei P60 device. So if your Huawei P60 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Huawei P60 device’s animation type and speed on your Huawei P60 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Huawei P60 to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Huawei P60 is running slow and freezing, the Huawei P60 device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues
