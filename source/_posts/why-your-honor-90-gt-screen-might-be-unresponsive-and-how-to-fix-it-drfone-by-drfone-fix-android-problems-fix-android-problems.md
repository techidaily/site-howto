This can happen to various models, such as the Honor 90 GT, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Dropping or impacting an Honor 90 GT device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Honor 90 GT Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Honor 90 GT device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Honor 90 GT device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

Another way to avoid Honor 90 GT Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Honor 90 GT device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Honor 90 GT device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues.
