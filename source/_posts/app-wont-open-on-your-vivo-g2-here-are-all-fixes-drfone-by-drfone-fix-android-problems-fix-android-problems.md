This guide teaches effective methods to **unbrick your Vivo G2**. The page will also discuss the early warning signs and healthy habits to prolong your Vivo G2. Read below to learn more.

## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Vivo G2 device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Vivo G2 device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Vivo G2 freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.

### Common Reasons for Your Vivo G2 Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Vivo G2 devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

Engaging in root access, flashing custom ROMs, or applying unsupported system modifications can destabilize the Vivo G2 device's software, paving the way for bricking.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Vivo G2 device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Vivo G2 device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.
