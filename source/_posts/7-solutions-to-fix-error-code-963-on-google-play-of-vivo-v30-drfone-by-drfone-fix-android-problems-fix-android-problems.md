## What Causes A Vivo V30 Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Vivo V30 phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Vivo V30 screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Vivo V30 screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Vivo V30 black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Vivo V30's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Vivo V30 device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Vivo V30 device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Vivo V30logo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Leaving the Vivo V30 device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Vivo V30 device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service
