### Reset Factory settings

If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.

Along with this, we would also suggest you go take backup of your data so that you won’t lose any of the personal information from your device after performing factory reset. For your convenience, we have stated the backup steps too in the following guide. Have a look:

- Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup & Reset”.

### Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz

We believe that you will find the above methods helpful. However, if still in case your **_TouchWiz is not working_**, we advice you that you should install a new theme launcher in your device. It will be a wise option to ditch TouchWiz in such scenario rather than tolerating the problem. Hope this advice will help you.
