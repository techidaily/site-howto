This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.

- **Unstable Internet**

If your Xiaomi Redmi A2 gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.

Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for.
