- **Devices Connected with Router**

Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.

- **Unstable Internet**

If your Xiaomi Redmi 12 gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.

Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.
