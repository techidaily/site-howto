- **Step 1:** Open
- **Step 2:** Go to **Device Maintenance > Storage**or go directly to Storage.

![storage in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-16.jpg)

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue.

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.

![search if spotify is down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-20.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Go to one or two and see what they say. If Spotify is down, you’ll need to wait for them to fix the problem.

### 11. Clear the Cache

When using different apps and websites, your device caches data from those sources. Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

![settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-22.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Go to **Apps**.

In the following sections, we're diving into the **"why is My OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G offline"** dilemma that many Android users face. We'll break down the possible reasons behind this common issue and guide you through simple steps on how to fix it. By the end of the article, you’ll be able to get back to smooth internet surfing on your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G. Let’s get started.

## Part 1: Why Does My OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G Say Offline?

When you encounter the “offline” error message, it can disrupt your usual smartphone activities. Suddenly, you find yourself unable to browse the internet, send or receive emails, or stay connected through instant messages.

It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

2. **Internet connection issues**

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.

3. **Glitches or bugs**

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

4. **Firewall restrictions**

In some cases, a firewall on your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G might be overly restrictive, preventing the OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G device from establishing a connection to the internet. This security measure, intended to protect your device, can sometimes go overboard and disrupt normal online functionality.

Now, you have understood the potential causes as the first step toward resolving the issue. Next, we'll guide you through the process of troubleshooting and getting your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G back online.

## Part 2: How To Fix “Phone Offline” With Internet Connection Problem

Now that we've figured out why your phone says it's offline, let's tackle the issue head-on. If you're facing problems like downloads that won't start, Google Play stuck on "Loading…," or web pages refusing to load, chances are it's an internet connection issue causing the problem.

### Solution 3: Reset network settings

Resetting network settings can help eliminate any configuration glitches that might be causing the phone offline problem. It's like giving your phone's connection settings a fresh start.
