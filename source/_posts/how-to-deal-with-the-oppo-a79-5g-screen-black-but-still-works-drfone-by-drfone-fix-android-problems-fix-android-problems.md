2\. Corrupted/Contaminated App file

When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.
