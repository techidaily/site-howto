Moreover, in case you use Chromebook, don’t forget to update the operating system in order to let it support Gmail.

3. Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.

Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.

### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending. If these are not so important, you can remove them and send the mail. Or if it is not possible to send the mail without attachments, compressing the files can be a solution.

### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your Vivo X Fold 2 in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.

### Clear Storage of Device
