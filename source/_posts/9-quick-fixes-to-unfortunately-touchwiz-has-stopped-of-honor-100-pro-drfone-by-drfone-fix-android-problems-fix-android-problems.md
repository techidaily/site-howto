2. Press and hold down the **Power** and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time for 15-30 minutes to reboot the Honor 100 Pro device.
3. Should the first two steps do not work, charge your Honor 100 Pro to get it out of the start-up loop. You can also opt to use a different battery, just in case your current battery is the source of the problem.
4. If there are any connected hardware e.g. SD card, remove them from the Honor 100 Pro device.
5. Start your Honor 100 Pro in **Safe Mode** by pressing and holding down the **Menu** or **Volume Down** button on your device.
6. Should the first five steps do not work for you, perform a hard reset. Do take note that each device will have a different way to do so and that data that is stored locally on the phone will be deleted.
7. Send your Honor 100 Pro to the repair shop should none of these steps work.
