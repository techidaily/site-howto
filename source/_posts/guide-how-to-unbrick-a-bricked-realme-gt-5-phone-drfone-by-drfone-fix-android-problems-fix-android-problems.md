## Part 1. Preliminary Reasons For Cellular Network Not Available For Voice Calls

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

### 3\. Network Congestion

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the Realme GT 5 device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.

### 5\. Battery or Power Issues

In some instances, [<u>insufficient battery power</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-your-phone-battery-health.html) or power-saving modes on devices can cause this issue.

## Fix the Error of Unfortunately the Process.com.android.phone Has Stopped on Realme GT 5

However, it can be frustrating when a sudden error disrupts our phone's functionality. One common error Android users encounter is the "Unfortunately, The process.com.android.phone has stopped" error. Fear not if you have come across this error message on your Realme GT 5.

This beginner's guide is here to help you understand the causes of this problem. It will also provide you with practical "unfortunately the phone has stopped solutions."

## Part 1: Learn Why Unfortunately the process.com.android.phone Has Stopped

The error message "****Unfortunately,**** ****the process com.android.phone has stopped****" typically appears on Android devices when there is an issue with the Phone app. Issues with underlying processes responsible for handling phone-related functions are also a cause.

![process com.android.phone has stopped error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/process-com-android-1.jpg)

It can prevent you from making or receiving phone calls, accessing contacts, or using other phone-related features. Following are some of the possible reasons why you may encounter this error:

### App or System Update

When you update your device's OS or the Phone app itself, it is possible to encounter bugs or compatibility issues. These issues can lead to the Phone app crashing and displaying this error message. Sometimes, the updated software may not work with the existing configurations of the Phone app. It results in instability which causes this error.

### App Cache/Data Corruption

The Phone app relies on cached data and stored settings to function properly. If the cache or data of the app becomes corrupted, it can cause the Phone app to malfunction. The reasons include interrupted app installations or updates, improper shutdowns, or software conflicts. As a result, you may see the error message indicating that the process com.android.phone has stopped.

### Insufficient System Resources

Android devices need sufficient memory (RAM) and processing power to run apps smoothly. If your device is running low on memory or processing capacity, it may struggle to handle the Phone app and its processes. It can lead to crashes and the error message. Running many resource-intensive apps at the same time also causes this issue. Other reasons include too many background processes that contribute to this error.

### Conflicting Third-Party Apps

Third-party apps installed on your device can sometimes conflict with the Phone app. These conflicts can occur for various reasons, such as incompatible app versions.
