![person holding their android with black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-1.jpg)

There’s a reason Android holds over two-thirds of the mobile operating system market share. It’s a powerful OS that gives you the utmost freedom and flexibility, allowing you to customize your phone to suit your needs.

However, regardless of the capabilities of Android phones and the features that come with their OS, just like any other smartphone, they’re prone to glitches and annoying issues – especially with their video files.

You may encounter **videos not playing on your Motorola Razr 40** more frequently than you like. Whether it’s video files you’ve recorded using your phone or files you’ve downloaded, this glitch can get pretty annoying pretty fast. Fortunately, there are several solutions you could try to fix it.

See what you can do if **videos won’t play on your Android.**

## Why Are My Videos Not Playing On Android?

![person recording cityscape using their android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-2.jpg)

Considering how most smartphone manufacturers tend to emphasize the unbelievable quality of their cameras, perfect night modes, seamless slow-motion recordings, superb resolution, and more, you’d expect all images and videos to function flawlessly on your Android. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case.

Occasionally, you could find that the videos you access from your gallery won’t play, sending you the message that “video cannot be played” or “can’t play video.” Other times, you might find that YouTube videos won’t load correctly or your downloaded videos won’t open in your media player.

There could be a wide variety of reasons that is happening, including:

- Corrupted video
- Corrupted SD card
- Outdated media player
- Outdated OS
- Incomplete download from the source
- Low storage
- Video downloaded from a suspicious source

An array of hardware and software issues could lead to you being unable to play videos on your Android. However, that doesn’t mean you should immediately send your device for repairs or delete the videos that won’t play. There might be a few better solutions you could try.

## What You Can Do if Your Videos Aren’t Playing On Android Phone

Since there are many reasons for having problems with videos not playing on your Android, you could also try many solutions.

### 1. Do a Factory Reset

![person holding a black android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-3.jpg)

While a factory reset shouldn’t always be the first solution you go to, it can usually prove to be the most effective one.

A factory reset, aka a master reset or a hard reset, returns all your software configurations to the original state when the phone was first manufactured. In the process, all your data is lost – any photos and videos you have on your phone and the apps you’ve installed will be deleted. You’ll be logged out of all your accounts and won’t have access to your message history, contacts, and more.

While it seems like an extreme step, it can help fix any video issues you might encounter due to software bugs.

Though there could be slight variations between different phones, you can usually perform a factory reset by going to **Settings > General Management > Reset > Factory data reset > Reset.**

![factory reset on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-4.jpg)

### 2. Restart Your Motorola Razr 40

While a factory reset is all but guaranteed to fix the issues you’re encountering with your videos, sometimes a simple restart might do the trick just fine. A restart works by clearing your RAM (Random Access Memory).

In a nutshell, RAM stores short-term data that helps your processor complete tasks quickly. This data is always easily accessible, and it’s what helps your phone quickly open webpages and apps you’ve recently used.

Over time, however, your RAM can get filled with unnecessary data and data fragments, which, in turn, can confuse your processor.

Restarting your phone will clear your RAM and potentially eliminate any data fragments causing your videos to be unplayable.

### 3. Check the Video Format

As a general rule of thumb, the videos you capture should be in a format your device supports. However, the videos you’ve downloaded might not be. That’s why checking the files’ video format before trying other possible fixes is in your best interest.

If the format isn’t supported, installing the right video player with the necessary compatibility is the most straightforward fix. Some of the most popular video players for Android include VLC for Android, GOM Player, MX Player, Bsplayer, and RealPlayer. You can easily find all of them in the Google Play Store.

### 4. Check the Internet Connection

![pull-down bar on android showing wifi is turned off](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-5.jpg)

If you’re having problems playing downloaded or online videos, check your internet connection to see if there’s an issue there. If your internet’s down, any downloaded videos might not have downloaded correctly, and any online videos that haven’t been loaded will not play.

Make sure that you turn the Airplane mode off and your Wi-Fi on. Check the connection and test your internet speed to see if everything works properly.

You might need a network reset if your phone can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network. The path might differ between Android devices, but you should be able to find the option for a network reset at the exact location of your factory reset. Go to **Settings > General Management > Reset > Reset Network settings > Reset settings**.

![android network reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-6.jpg)

### 5. Clear the Cache

The cache stores a copy of your most commonly used data, helping decrease loading time and improve your phone’s performance. However, too much cache data can take up too much space and cause data corruption, preventing you from accessing some of your apps.

On average, you should clear your phone’s cache every few months to ensure that everything runs smoothly. If you encounter issues with your videos not playing on Android, clearing the cache could be just the fix you need.

To clear the cache from your apps, you’ll want to go to **Settings > Apps.** From there, select the app you want to remove the cache from, scroll down to **Storage**, then choose **Clear Cache**.

![clear cache on android apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-7.jpg)

### 6. Update Android OS

An outdated Android OS is usually the culprit behind many bugs and glitches you may encounter on your phone. It can prevent you from playing video files, accessing apps, taking photos, and more. It can lead to data corruption and loss, expose you to malware and cyberattacks, and compromise phone performance.

Regularly updating your OS to its latest version is always in your best interest. It can solve the problem of your videos not playing and protect you and your sensitive data.

### 7. Repair Your Android OS

![person holding a phone with black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-8.jpg)

You might already have the latest version of Android OS, but that still doesn’t mean your OS is functioning as it should. Maybe your phone was interrupted while downloading or installing the new OS version. Maybe your phone had underlying OS issues, or you accidentally downloaded files you shouldn’t have. Whatever the case is, if your videos don’t play due to an OS problem, you’ll need to repair your OS.

The best way to do it is with a reliable Android OS repair solution like Wondershare Dr.Fone.

Remember that repairing your device with Wondershare Dr.Fone might result in data loss. Back up all your essential data before fixing your OS using this software to stay safe.

### 8. Update the Video App

Sometimes, it’s not the outdated OS version causing issues but rather the out-of-date video app. Like OS updates, app and other software updates often contain fixes for common problems and security patches. Not every update is there simply to introduce new features.

To check whether you’re using the latest version of your video player, go to **Settings > Apps**. Find your video player app, tap it, and scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the version installed on your phone.

![android app version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-14.jpg)

### 9. Clear Cookies and Browsing Data

If online videos are causing problems, not your recorded or downloaded ones, you might be due for a quick cookie and browsing data clearing.

Cookies are usually there to improve the user experience, allowing you to load websites faster and enjoy improved performance. However, if your cookies and browsing data occupy too much space, they could pose problems.

You’ll first need to launch your mobile browser to clear cookies and browsing data. If you’re using Google Chrome, the process is simple and streamlined. Tap the three dots in the upper right corner and go to **Settings**. From there, go to **Privacy and security > Clear browsing data > Clear data**.

### 10. Reinstall Video Apps

If you still have issues with videos not playing on your Motorola Razr 40, you could try deleting and reinstalling your video apps. Sometimes, simply updating the video app might still retain the glitch causing problems. However, if you delete it in its entirety and then install it again, the issue should be gone.

To uninstall the video app on your Android, go to **Settings > Apps**. Locate the app you want to delete, then tap **Uninstall** at the bottom of your screen.

To reinstall it again, go to the Google Play Store, search for the video app you want to have, then click **Install**.

Whatever the case is, don’t despair. There’s usually a solution that can fix the problem and ensure your device works as expected.

![turn on airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android-1.jpg)

## Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings

The third step you’ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Motorola Razr 40. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.

However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.

1. Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights
2. While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem
3. Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again
4. Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area
5. Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Motorola Razr 40 is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data

## Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode

![wifi not working on android - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg)

If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Motorola Razr 40 itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.

The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Motorola Razr 40, but the basic process goes as follows;

1. Turn off your Motorola Razr 40 by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Motorola Razr 40 device is completely off
2. Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time
3. You will see the words ‘Safe Mode’ appear on your screen as the Motorola Razr 40 device loads
4. Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works

If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, you’ll know you have a problem with an app or service that’s running on your device. If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.

## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

If you’re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, you’ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Motorola Razr 40 itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.

You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.

1. If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Motorola Razr 40 device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection
2. If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Motorola Razr 40 is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there
3. Whichever method you’re using, try disconnecting your Motorola Razr 40 and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Motorola Razr 40 needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Motorola Razr 40. Here’s how to check on your Motorola Razr 40 to make sure everything is correct.

1. Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Motorola Razr 40
2. Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router
3. Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router
4. Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches

When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.

## Part 7. Fix Android system issues in one click

If none of the solutions above are working, this could indicate a real problem with the firmware and operating system of your Motorola Razr 40. Fortunately, a fast solution to get everything working again is to completely repair the software of your phone.

## Part 8. Check the Wi-Fi connectivity on another phone

![android phone not connecting to wifi - connectivity on another phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

When experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, it’s worth noting the problem might not be with your phone, but rather the Wi-Fi network itself. This is why it’s important to make sure you check the connection on another device.

Of course, if you’re already using another phone on your Wi-Fi network, you know this isn’t the case. However, if you’re not sure, here’s what you need to do;

1. Get another Android or iOS phone or tablet
2. Open the Settings menu and connect to the Wi-Fi network you’re having problems with
3. Enter the password and connect to the network
4. Open a web browser on the phone and try loading a web page
5. If the page loads, you know the Wi-Fi network isn’t the problem
6. If the page doesn’t load, you know you’ve got a problem with your Wi-Fi network

## Part 9. Change the password of the Wi-Fi

![android phone not connecting to wifi - password settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-password.jpg)

Each Wi-Fi network router will give the opportunity to choose and change the password you have to let devices connect to your network. It’s important you try changing this because you never know if someone else has accessed your network and could be blocking your device. Here’s how it works;

1. Log onto your computer and open your Wi-Fi settings
2. Depending on the brand and method of your individual router, navigate to the Wi-Fi password settings menu
3. Change the password to something complicated using all available digits and characters
4. Save the password and restart the router to disconnect all devices
5. Now connect your Motorola Razr 40 to the router using the new password

## Part 10. Reset network settings on Android

![android phone not connecting to wifi - reset network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-network.jpg)

Just like the method above where you’ll be effectively resetting the network settings on your router, if this hasn’t worked, you’ll be able to reset the network settings on your Motorola Razr 40, hopefully removing the bugs and allowing you to connect.

Here’s how you can do this easily on your Motorola Razr 40;

1. From the home screen of your Motorola Razr 40, open the Settings menu
2. Tap the Backup & Reset option
3. Tap the Reset Network Settings option
4. Tap the Reset Network option
5. If you need to, enter the PIN number or passcode for the Android device, and the Motorola Razr 40 device will confirm the reset has taken place
6. Reconnect your Motorola Razr 40 to your Wi-Fi network for the changes to take effect

## Part 11. Clear partition cache in recovery mode

![wifi not working on android - clear partition](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-partitioncache.jpg)

As you continue to use your Motorola Razr 40, the partition cache will fill up with data your device needs and doesn’t need. However, by clearing your device’s partition cache, you can make clear up some space which should help your device have enough memory to connect to the internet.

1. Turn off your Motorola Razr 40
2. Turn it on by holding down the power button, volume button, and home button
3. When your phone vibrates, let go of the Power button, but continue to hold the volume button
4. When a menu is displayed, use the volume buttons to navigate the menu
5. Select the Android System Recovery option, followed by Wipe Cache Partition
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet

## Part 12. Reset factory settings

![wifi not working on android - factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-factory-reset.jpg)

If worse comes to worst, another option you have is to factory reset your Motorola Razr 40. As we’ve spoken about above, while using your phone from the day you started using it, your device will fill up with files and data which can become messy and causes bugs.

However, by factory resetting your device, you can start again from the factory default from which you first received it, ultimately clearing the bugs. Make sure you back up your device before proceeding because it will erase your personal files.

1. Open the Settings menu on your Motorola Razr 40
2. Navigate to System > Advanced > Reset Options
3. Tap the Reset phone option, and enter your PIN code if required
4. Tap Erase Everything
5. Wait for your phone to complete the process
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet
