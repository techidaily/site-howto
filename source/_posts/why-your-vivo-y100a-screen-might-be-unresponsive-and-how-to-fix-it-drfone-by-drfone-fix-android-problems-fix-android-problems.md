Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Vivo Y100A device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Vivo Y100A, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Vivo Y100A device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Vivo Y100A F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Below are some possible causes of Vivo Y100A screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot.

### 1.Â Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Vivo Y100A black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Vivo Y100A's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Vivo Y100A device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Vivo Y100A device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Vivo Y100Alogo appears.

### 2.Â Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Leaving the Vivo Y100A device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Vivo Y100A device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device.
