With a full backup of your Vivo V27 Pro, you can now embark on a mission to fix the error. There are several methods to clear this error. We have outlined three of the most effective solutions here.

### Method 1: Ensure app and system updates

Step 1: Go to "Settings" on your device.

Step 2: Access "Apps."

Step 3: Tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner and select "Reset App Preferences."

### Method 3: Clear the cache and data on your device

Step 6: Turn off the Vivo V27 Pro device and then turn it back on. Go to the Google Services framework again and turn it on to see if the issue has been resolved.

### Method 4: Check Google Sync & Media Storage settings

![snapchat stopping - check for android update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-update-firmware.png)

Similar to some of the other solutions we’ve listed above, if you’re using an outdated version of the Android operating system, but the latest version of Snapchat is coded to the most recent, this can be a cause for the Snapchat crashing on Android problem to occur.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Vivo V27 Pro, followed by the Wi-Fi option.

One of the last resorts you can take is factory resetting your Vivo V27 Pro back to its original settings. From the day you first started using your device, you’ve been using the system and downloading files and apps, and over time this increases the chances of creating a bug.
