The unavailability of your device can disrupt your routine and connectivity. However, unbricking is the crucial solution to regain the functionality of your Oppo A18 device.

This guide teaches effective methods to **unbrick your Oppo A18**. The page will also discuss the early warning signs and healthy habits to prolong your Oppo A18. Read below to learn more.

## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Oppo A18 device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Oppo A18 device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Oppo A18 freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.
- **Consistent Black Screens.**Experiencing recurring black screens could indicate problems within the operating system. In the long run, this might escalate to bricking.

### Common Reasons for Your Oppo A18 Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Oppo A18 devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Failed Updates or Interrupted Installations

When a firmware update is interrupted due to power loss, sudden device shutdown, or other disruptions, it can result in incomplete software installation and potential bricking.

#### Unauthorized User Modifications

Engaging in root access, flashing custom ROMs, or applying unsupported system modifications can destabilize the Oppo A18 device's software, paving the way for bricking.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Oppo A18 device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Oppo A18 device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.
