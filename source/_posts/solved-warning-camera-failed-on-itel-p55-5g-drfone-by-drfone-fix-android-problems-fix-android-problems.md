1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Itel P55 5G showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Itel P55 5G. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

2. **Internet connection issues**

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My Itel P55 5G offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.
