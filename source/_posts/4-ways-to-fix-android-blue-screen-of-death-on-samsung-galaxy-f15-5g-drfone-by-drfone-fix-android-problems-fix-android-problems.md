Below are some possible causes of Samsung Galaxy F15 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot.

These issues can also occur in any Samsung Galaxy F15 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons.

### 1. Restart The Device

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Samsung Galaxy F15 5G black screen problem.
