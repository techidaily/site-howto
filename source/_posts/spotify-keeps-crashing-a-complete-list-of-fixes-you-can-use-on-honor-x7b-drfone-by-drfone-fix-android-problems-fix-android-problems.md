- **Step 1:** Open
- **Step 2:** Go to **Device Maintenance > Storage**or go directly to Storage.

![storage in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-16.jpg)

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.

- **Step 4:** Go to one or two and see what they say. If Spotify is down, you’ll need to wait for them to fix the problem.

### 11. Clear the Cache

When using different apps and websites, your device caches data from those sources. Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:

## Calls on Honor X7b Go Straight to Voicemail? 12 Fixes

Have you ever experienced incoming calls to your **phone go straight to voicemail** without ringing? It can be frustrating, especially if you’re expecting an important call. It could be due to simple things like turning down the volume or forgetting to turn off the Do Not Disturb mode. In other cases, it might be because you accidentally blocked the caller’s number.

In most cases, incoming calls going to voicemail without ringing are common. However, if it’s happening frequently or for all calls, your phone may have a problem.

This article will discuss why incoming **phone calls go straight to voicemail** and how to fix the problem. We’ll also show you how to use Wondershare Dr.Fone, a powerful Android System Repair tool, to solve such issues. So, if you’re uncertain why that last **call went straight to voicemail**, keep reading, and we’ll cover everything you need to know.

![phone voicemail notification representation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Not Ringing? Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail

If an incoming call to your **cell phone goes straight to voicemail** without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:

1. Turn Off Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode

DND mode is a feature that silences all incoming calls, notifications, and alerts. If DND mode is enabled, your **cell phone goes straight to voicemail** when someone calls. To turn off DND mode, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification settings panel, then tap the **Do not disturb** icon.

![do not disturb mode not enabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-02.jpg)

Here’s an alternative way:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app and go to **Notifications**.
- **Step 2:** Tap **Do not disturb**.

![notifications settings interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-03.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Toggle **Do Not Disturb** offto disable the mode.

2. Turn Off Call Forwarding

One reason calls go **straight to voicemail without ringing** is if you enabled call forwarding. Call forwarding is a feature that redirects incoming calls to another number. To turn off call forwarding:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone Dialer** app on your device, then tap the **menu** icon and select **Settings**.

![phone dial app settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-04.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Navigate to **Supplementary services** > **Call forwarding**.

![call settings supplementary services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-05.jpg)

3. Disable Call Barring

If a phone **call went straight to voicemail**, another possible explanation is the call barring. It is a feature that restricts calls from being made or received on your phone. If activated, it can cause incoming calls to a phone to go straight to voicemail. To turn off call barring on Honor X7b devices:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone Dialer** app, then tap the **menu** icon in the top right corner.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Settings** > **Supplementary services** > **Call barring**, then tap **OK**.
- **Step 3:** Select **Voice call**, then turn off your preferred outgoing and incoming calls. When prompted, enter 0000 as a password.

![call barring settings interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-06.jpg)

4. Update Your Phone’s Software

Sometimes, software bugs can cause problems with incoming calls, which may be why your last incoming **call went straight to voicemail**. If your phone runs outdated software, try updating it to the latest version.

To check for updates, open the **Settings** app and go to **Software update** or **System update**. For a seamless update experience, follow the step-by-step instructions on your mobile screen.

![software update settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-07.jpg)

5. Reset Network Settings

If the incoming calls on your **phone go straight to voicemail**, consider resetting your phone’s network settings. Network settings control how your phone connects to the cellular network. If these settings are not set up correctly, incoming calls may not be able to reach your device.

**Note:** Resetting your network settings will erase any saved Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth pairings, requiring you to re-enter them after the reset is complete.

To reset your network settings on most Android devices:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your smartphone, then tap **System** or **General Management**.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Reset** > **Reset Network Settings** and confirm the action.

![phone reset network settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-08.jpg)

6. Turn Off Bluetooth

When Bluetooth is on, it can interfere with your device’s ability to receive calls, causing them to go **straight to voicemail without ringing**. To turn off [<u> Bluetooth</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-16/fix-wifi-bluetooth-issues-after-upgrading-ios-16.html) on an Android device, you can do one of the following:

- Swipe down from the top of the screen to open the Quick Settingspanel, then tap the **Bluetooth** icon to turn it off.

![bluetooth not enabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-09.jpg)

![turn off bluetooth on settings app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-10.jpg)

It should help ensure that calls come through to your phone instead of going to voicemail.

7. Check Airplane Mode

If turning off Bluetooth didn’t solve the issue, another possible cause could be that your phone is in Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode turns off all wireless connections on your phone, including cellular service, which can cause calls to **dial straight to voicemail**. There are two ways to turn off Airplane mode on Android:

Using the Settings app:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app.
- **Step 2:** Tap **Network & internet**.
- **Step 3:** Toggle off **Airplane mode** or **Flight mode**.

Using the Quick Settings panel:

- **Step 1:** Swipe down from the top of the phone screen to access the **Quick Settings** panel.
- **Step 2:** Look for the **Airplane mode** or **Flight mode** icon, then tap it to turn it off.

![airplane mode on](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-11.jpg)

8. Check Blocked Numbers

**“My boyfriend’s phone goes straight to voicemail** when someone is calling. Any idea why that might be?”

Do you also find yourself asking what does it mean? It could be that he has blocked that phone number. To check this:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone dialer** app.
- **Step 2:** Tap the **menu** icon in the top right corner and select **Settings**.
- **Step 3:** Tap **Block numbers**. If you find the number in the blocked list, remove it to ensure that their calls come through to the phone.

![block numbers on the phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-12.jpg)

If you still have trouble reaching your boyfriend, try calling him from a different number. If your call didn’t go through, you know that he hasn’t blocked your number and that there may be another issue with his phone.

9. Turn Off Google One VPN

If you’re using Google One VPN, try turning it off to see if that fixes the problem. Some users have reported that Google One VPN can cause incoming calls to a **phone to go straight to voicemail**. To turn off Google One VPN:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Google One** app on your Honor X7b.
- **Step 2:** At the bottom, go to the **Benefits** tab, then tap **View Details** below the **Online protection with a VPN** section.

![google one app interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-13.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Toggle off **Enable VPN**.

![turn off google one vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-14.jpg)

10. Contact Your Carrier

If your **phone calls go straight to voicemail** after trying all the above, contact your carrier for help. They may be able to troubleshoot the problem or determine if there is a service outage in your area.

And if your carrier confirms that there is no service outage or billing-related block, the problem may be with your phone itself. You may need to try resetting your phone to factory settings or taking it to a repair shop.

11. The Caller Used Ringless Voicemail

Ringless voicemail is a service that allows businesses to bypass your phone’s ringtone and send you pre-recorded messages directly to voicemail. Ringless voicemail is often used for marketing purposes. If you think you’re receiving ringless voicemail calls, you can contact the company calling you and ask them to remove you from their list.
