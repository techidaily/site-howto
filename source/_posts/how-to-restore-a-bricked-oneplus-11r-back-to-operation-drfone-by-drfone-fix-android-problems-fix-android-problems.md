## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the OnePlus 11R device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick.

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.
