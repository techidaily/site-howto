## Part 1: Understanding Stuck and Dead Nokia 105 Classics on Phone Screens

While dead and ****stuck pixels on the phone**** may seem similar, there are important distinctions between the two. Read on to discover the differences and what causes them.

### Stuck Nokia 105 Classics on Phone

A ****stuck pixel phone**** is always on, so it shows up on a touchscreen as a bright, persistent dot of red, green, blue, or white. Combinations are also possible, and although it is usually stationary, this dot occasionally flickers.

### Dead Nokia 105 Classics on Smartphones

In contrast to the stuck pixel, the dead pixel subpixels are all left unpowered, turning them off. A ****dead pixel on the phone**** is a tiny, persistent rectangle of black or white color on the part of the phone screen not working.

### Some Differences Between Stuck and Dead Nokia 105 Classics on Phone

Stuck pixels may have less effect on the user experience than ****dead pixels on the phone**** **screen** since they still display color. But dead pixels may be more disturbing because they are either black or white.

It is easy to mistake stuck and ****dead pixels on the phone**** for one other, but they are unique issues with different causes and effects. Read on to understand the differences and how they affect your phone's display.

- ****Power****. The stuck pixel on your device always receives energy, causing it to display a specific color while the dead pixel is permanently off, resulting in a black spot on your phone screen.
- ****Possibility of repair****. You can quickly fix ****stuck pixels on the phone,****while some may even disappear on their own. However, dead pixels are more challenging to repair.

Stuck and ****dead pixels on phone screen****s can happen for various reasons, including manufacturing defects, physical damage, and age-related wear and tear. These ****broken pixels on the phone**** can hurt the user experience, and it is essential to know the root causes to prevent them from occurring in the first place.

- ****Manufacturing defects****. During manufacturing, some pixels may not work due to poor quality control, resulting in stuck or ****dead pixels on the phone**** In other words, if the power transfer issue isn't completely fixed, you might see more dead pixels.
- ****Physical damage****. Accidents such as dropping the phone or exposure to extreme heat or cold can damage the screen and cause stuck or dead pixels. For instance, the ****upper part of the touch screen not working****may also occur due to pressure on the display when the phone is placed in a pocket with other sharp objects.

![person holding a gadget with pen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-03.jpg)

****Step 1:**** Check for chips, cracks, or any other signs of damage on the screen if your ****phone touch screen is not working in some areas****. If you find any damage, you may need to take your phone to a professional repair shop or consider getting a replacement.

![phone with damaged screen from dropping](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-04.jpg)

****Step 3:**** Remove any gloves you may be wearing and any stickers placed over the screen or sensors. Gloves and stickers can interfere with the touchscreen and affect the accuracy of fixing the ****broken pixels on the phone****.

****Step 4:**** Finally, ensure that your screen is clean and free from any smudges or dirt that could affect the accuracy of fixing ****dead pixels on the phone****.

****Step 1:**** Press and hold down the ****power key**** on your Nokia 105 Classic until the ****power menu**** appears.

**Tip:**

If your Nokia 105 Classic is unresponsive to the usual restart method because a ****part of the phone screen is not working****, try a forced restart by holding the ****power button**** for at least 10 seconds.

### Option 3: Check If Stuck Nokia 105 Classic Phone Only Appears in Specific Mobile Apps

If the previous method did not work, check if the ****stuck pixels on the phone**** only appear in specific mobile apps. Sometimes, stuck pixels may only show up when using particular apps, so identifying which app is causing the issue can help pinpoint the problem.

****Step 2:**** Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the ****stuck pixel phone**** display. Next, turn off ****Safe Mode****.

****Step 3:**** To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.

### Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset

Consider a factory data reset if the previous options did not resolve your issue with stuck or dead pixels on the phone screen. This process will erase all data from your device, so remember to back up any important information before proceeding.

****Step 1:**** Open the ****Settings**** application.

**Step 2:** Choose ****System > Reset > Erase all data (factory reset) > Erase all data****.

![smartphone reset settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-09.jpg)

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

Aside from the methods and tools discussed for fixing ****dead pixels on phone screen****s and ****stuck pixels on the phone****, you may still have some questions regarding the issues. Whether you are dealing with a single stuck pixel or a cluster of dead pixels, this section aims to provide you with helpful insights.

### 1\. Can Dead Nokia 105 Classics Fix Themselves?

No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Nokia 105 Classics Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

### 3\. Why Are Dead Nokia 105 Classics Spreading on My Nokia 105 Classic?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Nokia 105 Classics Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Nokia 105 Classic devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.

With this knowledge, you can apply the different tools and techniques for removing ****stuck pixels on phone**** screens and how to work around dead pixels on the phone screen.

First of all, you need to make sure that the browser you are using works with Gmail or not. Gmail can smoothly perform in Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. However, the browsers should be updated. So, please make sure that these browsers are running on the latest versions. Moreover, in case you use Chromebook, don’t forget to update the operating system in order to let it support Gmail.

### Clear Cache of web browser

If you tried the above method but to no avail, try to clear the cache and cookies of the web browser. But by doing so, the browser history will be removed. As well as, the records of the websites you previously enjoyed will also be lost.

### Check browser extensions or add-ons

 If not the above one, try this tip. It encourages you to check your browser extensions. Perhaps these are interfering with the Gmail and due to this conflict, Gmail won’t load. You can either turn off these extensions and plug-ins temporarily or make use of the incognito mode of the browser where there are no such things like extensions and plug-ins.

## Problem 4: Gmail can’t send or receive

Gmail also gives you problem in sending or receive mails and messages. And to troubleshoot such issue, following are the solutions mentioned.

### Check the Latest Version of Gmail

### Verify Internet Connection

Another thing that carries weight while you can send or receive mails is the internet connection. As we all know that Gmail won’t respond if the Nokia 105 Classic device is not connected to the internet. Therefore, you are advised to turn off Wi-Fi and then enable it again. Also, please ensure to switch to Wi-Fi if you are using the cellular data. This may hamper the process and stop you from receiving or sending mails.

### Remove you Account and Add Again

If still Gmail keeps stopping you to go ahead, make sure to once sign out from it. To do this:

1. Open your Gmail app and go to “Manage accounts on this device”.

## Problem 5: Stuck in sending

Now, here is another annoying problem that doesn’t let Gmail working on Android properly. This problem addresses the situation where users send a mail but it gets stuck on sending. If this is the problem that you are going through, the following solutions will help you.

### Try Alternative Gmail Address

First of all, if Gmail is not working due to stuck in sending issue, we advise you to make use of some other Gmail address to send the mail. If the problem still occurs, jump to the next solution.

### Check Network Connection

As already mentioned, be sure of an active internet connection while working with Gmail. When you are not using a stable connection, it may lead to stuck on sending, Gmail crashing and many other issues. You can fix the issue by doing these three things:

1. Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.
2. Turn off Wi-Fi and then turn it on again after nearly 5 seconds. Do the same with the router. Plug it out and the plug in.
3. Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.

Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.

### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending. If these are not so important, you can remove them and send the mail. Or if it is not possible to send the mail without attachments, compressing the files can be a solution.

## Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue

As we also mentioned in one of the above solutions, you can either delete the unnecessary files or transfer the important files to the PC to make the space in the phone. Go along with this tip and see if it works.

## Problem 7: Gmail app running slow

The last problem that you may face is the slow-going Gmail app. In simple words, you may experience that Gmail app is operating extremely slowly. To fix this, following solutions will help you.

### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your Nokia 105 Classic in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.

### Clear Storage of Device

As the apps need space to function quickly and appropriately, having the Nokia 105 Classic device on low storage can prove to be a bad luck for Gmail. So, make sure you wipe out the items you no longer needed on your device and create some room so that the Gmail responds nicely and won’t be running slow anymore.

### Update Gmail App
