### 3\. Re-enable disabled app

**App icons can also disappear on the Android** home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them.

Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.

Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.
