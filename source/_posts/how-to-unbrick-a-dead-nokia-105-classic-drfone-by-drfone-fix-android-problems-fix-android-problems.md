- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Nokia 105 Classic freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Nokia 105 Classic device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Nokia 105 Classic device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.
