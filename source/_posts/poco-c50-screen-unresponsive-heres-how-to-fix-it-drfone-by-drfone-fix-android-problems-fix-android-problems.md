Poco C50 phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Poco C50 touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Poco C50 phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Poco C50 touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Poco C50 Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Poco C50 phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Poco C50 screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Poco C50 Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Poco C50 device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Poco C50 screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Poco C50 model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Poco C50 Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Poco C50 Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Poco C50 screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Poco C50 model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Poco C50 black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Poco C50's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Poco C50 device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Poco C50 device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Poco C50logo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Poco C50 device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Poco C50 device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Poco C50 device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Poco C50 device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Poco C50 device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Poco C50 Y2 and Poco C50 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Poco C50 device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

You can clear your cached data using the default settings.

- Select **Settings**\> **Storage** > **Cached Data**.

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Poco C50 device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Poco C50 device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Poco C50 device, so it should only be considered a last resort.

In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Poco C50 Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.

## Part 2. 10 common ways to fix Android won't charge

### 1\. Check/replace charging cable

Charging cables fray or become defunct after prolonged usage. Therefore, it is advised to always use the Poco C50 device’s original charging cable or purchase a good quality charging cord, which doesn't damage your device or your adapter.

It is also very commonly observed that the charging end of the cable which gets connected to the charging port of the Poco C50 device gets damaged and prevents the current from flowing to the phone/tablet.

![charging cable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459762305.jpg)

### 2\. Check/clean charging port

The charging port in your device is a small opening where the charging end of the cabbie is inserted for the current to flow to the phone/tablet. Very often, we notice that the charging port gets blocked with tiny particles of dirt. The charging port might also get clogged if dirt and dust get accumulated in it, preventing the sensors from receiving and forwarding the current to the Poco C50 device.

![check charging port](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459938188.jpg)

The best way to take this problem is to clean the port with a blunt pin or a soft bristle unused toothbrush. Make sure you clean the port gently and do not damage it or its sensors.

### 3\. Check/replace charging adapter

This method is fairly simple, and all you need to do is check whether or not the charging adapter is working properly as sometimes, the adapter itself is to be blamed for the charge. To make sure that you are not using a defective adapter, connect your charging cable/USB to another adapter. If your device charges normally, it means there is a problem is with your adapter, and you must replace it at the earliest to solve My Poco C50 won't charge the issue.

### 4\. Try another power source

This technique is more like a quick trick. It means to switch from one power source to another or use a more efficient and suitable power source. Laptops and PCs charge slower than a direct power source, i.e., a wall socket. Sometimes, the charging speed is slower, and the battery is draining. In such a scenario, choose to charge your device by directly plugging it into a socket on the wall to never experience My Poco C50 won't charge problem.

Follow the steps given below to clear your device’s cache:

In the following sections, we're diving into the **"why is My Poco C50 offline"** dilemma that many Android users face. We'll break down the possible reasons behind this common issue and guide you through simple steps on how to fix it. By the end of the article, you’ll be able to get back to smooth internet surfing on your Poco C50. Let’s get started.

## Part 1: Why Does My Poco C50 Say Offline?

When you encounter the “offline” error message, it can disrupt your usual smartphone activities. Suddenly, you find yourself unable to browse the internet, send or receive emails, or stay connected through instant messages.

It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Poco C50 showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Poco C50. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

2. **Internet connection issues**

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My Poco C50 offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.

3. **Glitches or bugs**

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Poco C50 can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

4. **Firewall restrictions**

In some cases, a firewall on your Poco C50 might be overly restrictive, preventing the Poco C50 device from establishing a connection to the internet. This security measure, intended to protect your device, can sometimes go overboard and disrupt normal online functionality.

Now, you have understood the potential causes as the first step toward resolving the issue. Next, we'll guide you through the process of troubleshooting and getting your Poco C50 back online.
