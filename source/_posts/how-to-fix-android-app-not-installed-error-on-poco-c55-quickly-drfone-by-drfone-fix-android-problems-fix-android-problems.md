![black phone with android logo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Should We Know About Poco C55 Android System WebView Crashes?

This year, the term "**Android WebView crash 2023**" has become a familiar and dreaded phrase. This issue has plagued Android users, causing app crashes, [freezing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-frozen/iphone-keeps-freezing.html), and frustration. But what exactly is Android WebView, and what triggers these apps to crash?

Android WebView is an integral component of Android apps, acting as the invisible engine that renders web content within these apps. It allows users to seamlessly browse websites, watch videos, and interact with web pages without switching to a separate browser. However, when WebView crashes, it disrupts this integrated experience, causing apps to malfunction.

Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing **Android WebView crash**. These include:

- **App Freezing**

One of the earliest signs of an **Poco C55 Android System WebView crash** is the app freezing. The app may become unresponsive, refusing to respond to your taps or gestures.

- **Unexpected App Closures**

Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. **Poco C55 Android System WebView crashing apps** can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.

- **Error Messages**

Error messages can also provide valuable clues about the impending crash. These messages may appear as pop-ups or be displayed within the app itself.

![webview crash google app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-02.jpg)

- **Slow Loading Times**

Slow loading times can also be a sign of an impending crash. If webpages within the app take unusually long to load or images and other content appear pixelated or distorted, it could be a sign that Poco C55 Android System WebView is struggling to handle the workload.

But why does WebView crash Android smartphones? The answer involves several factors:

- **Updates and Compatibility Issues**
