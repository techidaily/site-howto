Having your ****phone stuck on the logo**** screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.

![samsung stuck on boot screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg)

This article will share the possible reasons why your ****phone is stuck on the boot screen****. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!

It is not uncommon for **phones** to be ****stuck on the startup screen****, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.

### Physical Damage to the Phone

If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your ****phone being stuck on the boot screen****.

If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your ****phone getting stuck on the logo.****

### Liquid Damage

It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.

Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your ****phone stuck on the boot screen****. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.

For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.

![iphone water indicator](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg)

### Software Issues

Software issues are probably the most common reason your ****phone is stuck on the logo**** screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.

The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the ****phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.**** Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.

## Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen

After understanding the common problems on why your phone is ****stuck on the startup screen**** page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.

### Hard reboot your phone

To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting ****stuck on the startup screen**** page.

### Put your phone in recovery mode

If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.

****Step 3****: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.

### Factory Reset

If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your **phone being stuck on the startup screen** through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.

- **Step 4**: Input your password and confirm the action.

Your phone will now restart and start the reset process. Once the factory reset completes, your phone will look brand new, and you’ll need to install all your apps again. Moreover, your Google Play Services app will likely get fixed by this, too.

### 2. Update Your System

As keeping your phone’s system and apps updated to the latest possible version is essential and recommended for the best performance and highest efficiency, you can try updating it to see whether it fixes your Google Play Services error. Here’s how:

- **Step 1**: Open the **Settings**
- **Step 2**: Head into **System**\> **System update**.
- **Step 3**: If there’s an update available, click it and go through the process of updating your phone’s system.

Restarting your phone after an update, even if it doesn’t restart itself, is highly advisable, ensuring that the new updates apply without issues.

### 3. Revert to the Previous Version

As we’ve discussed the wrong Play Services versions above, it’s worth noting that sometimes even the developers can make mistakes and roll out the wrong version for your phone. So, if you notice that the phone is getting the error after you’ve updated Google Services or the Play Store, you can quickly revert to the previous version, and here’s how:

- **Step 1**: Head into **Settings**\> **Apps** > **Google Play Services.**
- **Step 2**: Press the **Disable**button at the bottom of the screen.
- **Step 3**: Restart the phone, repeat the process by clicking **Enable**this time, and restart the phone again.

As these are system apps, you can’t remove them from the phone, and disabling them will only remove the updates, leaving you with a base version that came with your phone out of the box.

### 4. Uninstall the App’s Updates and Reinstall

Like reverting to the previous version, you can also try reinstalling updates to fix the Google Play Services has stopped working error. The process is similar to the one above, but we’ve still included the steps. Here’s how you can do that:

- **Step 1**: Go into **Settings**\> **Apps** and find **Google Play Services**.
- **Step 2**: Tap it and press **Uninstall Updates**at the bottom.

    ![uninstall google play services updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-3.jpeg)

- **Step 3**: Exit the **Settings**app and restart the phone.
- **Step 4**: Open the **Play Store**app and head into the app’s settings by clicking your profile icon. Then scroll to the bottom, and tap **Settings**.
- **Step 5**: Find and tap the **Play Store version**to update your **Google Play Services**.

As you’re already there, you might as well update all other apps after you tap **Manage apps & device**. That will ensure that older and not-up-to-date apps aren’t causing the issue.

### 5. Check Storage

Believe it or not, one of the leading causes of the Google Play Services issue is a phone overfilled with apps. Namely, if you have insufficient storage, the Google Play Store app will likely crash and display errors such as “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped working.”

Head into your phone’s Settings and select Storage to see how your phone’s doing storage-wise. Deleting a few apps you don’t use and transferring your photo and video library to a PC is highly advisable if your phone’s storage space lacks gigabytes.

### 6. Do a System Repair

Although the other solutions here are general fixes that might help, a system repair might take a bit longer but will undoubtedly fix your issue. You can use the Wondershare Dr.Fone app to repair the system and eliminate the annoying “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped working” error.

Moreover, Dr. Fone works on Android and iOS devices and can fix various phone issues, including boot loops, a white screen of death, a stuck phone, etc. That’s why we’ve included a guide on using it for an Android phone issue. Here’s how:

- **Step 1**: Launch the Wondershare Dr.Fone app on your PC and head into **Toolkit**\> **System Repair** > **Android**.

That’s all it takes to do a system repair with Wondershare Dr.Fone. Give the software a few minutes to complete, during which your phone might restart a few times. Once it’s done, your Google Play Services app will undoubtedly work.

### 7. Clear Cache

The easiest and the most obvious fix for many Android apps is clearing the app’s cache. Here’s how you can do that for Google Play Services and Google Play Store:

- **Step 1**: Go into **Settings**\> **Apps** and find the **Google Play Store**
- **Step 2**: Tap **Storage**and hit the **Clear cache**

    ![clear app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-10.jpg)

- **Step 3**: Repeat the process for the **Google Play Services**

If this doesn’t work, move on to another possible fix.

### 8. Check Date and Time Settings

Oddly enough, the Google Play Services app is prone to failure because of an incorrectly set time or date. That’s because Google’s servers constantly check these settings before issuing updates to the Vivo Y100 devices, so you’ll need to ensure they’re correct beforehand. Here’s how:

- **Step 1**: Head into **Settings**\> **System** > **Date & Time**.
- **Step 2**: Ensure that both “**_Use network–provided time_**” and “**_Use network-provided time zone_**” are toggled on.

    ![check date and time settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-11.jpg)

- **Step 3**: If this doesn’t work, you can try repeating the process and manually setting the time and the time zone.

Once you check or change these settings, try using the Google Play Store app and check whether the issue is fixed. Restarting the phone after changing the settings is also highly advisable.

### 9. Troubleshoot Your Internet Connection

Another regularly overlooked troublemaker is a poor internet connection. That’s because most apps nowadays are meant to work in online mode only, and losing connection or using a bad one interferes with the app’s functionality.

To test the internet connection on your Vivo Y100, you should open a browser and head to a random internet page to see if it’s opening and whether there are any delays. If it’s working fine, your internet connection isn’t the problem.

### 10. Adjust Google Play Services Permissions

Although permissions rarely change, they can cause issues if you change them accidentally. These settings can be found in the same place where you would uninstall updates or clear the app’s cache, so you can use some of the steps mentioned above to check them.

Once inside Permission Settings, check whether the Google Play Services and Play Store apps have sufficient permission to do their jobs and whether any required permissions were recently removed. If so, grant these two apps their permissions back.
