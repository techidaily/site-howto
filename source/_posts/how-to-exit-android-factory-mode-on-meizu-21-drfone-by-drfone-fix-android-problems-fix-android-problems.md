## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Meizu 21 device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Meizu 21 device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Meizu 21 freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.

### Common Reasons for Your Meizu 21 Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Meizu 21 devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Meizu 21 device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Meizu 21 device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.
