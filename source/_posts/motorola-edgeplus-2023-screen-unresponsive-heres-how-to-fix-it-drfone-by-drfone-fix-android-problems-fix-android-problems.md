These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Motorola Edge+ (2023) touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Motorola Edge+ (2023) phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Motorola Edge+ (2023) touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Motorola Edge+ (2023) Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Motorola Edge+ (2023) phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Motorola Edge+ (2023) screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Motorola Edge+ (2023) Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Motorola Edge+ (2023) device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Motorola Edge+ (2023) screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Motorola Edge+ (2023) model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Motorola Edge+ (2023) Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Motorola Edge+ (2023) Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Motorola Edge+ (2023) screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Motorola Edge+ (2023) black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

By restarting the Motorola Edge+ (2023) device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Motorola Edge+ (2023) device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Motorola Edge+ (2023)logo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)
