## How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Vivo S17e

With the increase in our reliance on smartphones, having **touchscreen problems** on your device can be annoying. Sometimes, it’s even more frustrating than a physically broken screen because you don’t know where the issue is coming from.

If your **touchscreen is malfunctioning** or doesn’t work correctly, you cannot interact with your device. On this page, you’ll learn general **phone touch problems** on Android and how to get rid of them. Now explore the article to learn more.

![android screen problems intro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Is My Android Experiencing Touch Screen Problems

Below are some of the most common reasons you’re experiencing touch problems on your Android smartphone.

- The **touchscreen problem**freezes your phone, lags, or hangs.
- Some parts of the screen work fine, but some don’t.
- Your screen responds inaccurately (typing “a” gets you “q” or “z”).
- The touchscreen is automatically operating itself, resulting in ghost touch.
- It doesn’t respond to any taps, and the phone’s screen has stopped working.
- The device is physically damaged, or the screen is cracked or broken.
- Outdated devices are prone to the black/white/blue screen of death.

## Part 2: Tips, Fixes, and Workarounds To Fix Your Vivo S17e Touch Problems

If any of the outlined reasons above are the cause of your **touch screen malfunctioning,** here are some solutions to fix it.

### Method 1: Remove the Screen Protector and Phone Case

Some phone cases and screen protectors cause **touch problems** on your Android screen. This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.

![android remove screen protector](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg)

### Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone

A **touchscreen malfunctioning** can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.

![android dirty screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg)

### Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While

**Touch problems** also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.

### Method 4: Restart Your Android

Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a **touchscreen problem** on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.

![android restart method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg)

To restart your Android, press and hold the **Power** button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the **Power** button as well as the **Volume Down** button at the same time.

### Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android

Before attempting to have your device checked for any hardware defects, you should try completing a Factory Reset. To do this, go to **Settings > Backup and Reset.** Next, tap on **Factory data reset** \> **Delete all**.

![android factory data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg)

Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.

### Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode

If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.

**Note**

Placing your Android into **Recovery Mode** is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Vivo S17e.

**Step 1A**: Press and hold the **Power** button and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.

**Step 1B**: If your Vivo S17e still has a **Home** button, press and hold the **Home** button and the **Power** button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.

**Step 1C**: If step 1A did not put your Android into **Recovery Mode**, press and hold the **Power** and **Volume Up** and **Down** buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.

![android recovery mode 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg)

**Step 2**: Use the **Volume** buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data/factory reset, and confirm your choice with the **Power** button.

![android recovery mode 02](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg)

**Step 3**: Wait for the process to complete and for your Vivo S17e to restart automatically.

### Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen

If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the **touchscreen problem,** it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Vivo S17e checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.

![图像](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-08.jpg)"

### Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center

Your **phone touch problem** might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced. If your Android is still unresponsive, it’s best to bring your smartphone to an authorized service center or directly to the phone manufacturer, especially when all efforts are exhausted.
