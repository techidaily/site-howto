Android WebView is an integral component of Android apps, acting as the invisible engine that renders web content within these apps. It allows users to seamlessly browse websites, watch videos, and interact with web pages without switching to a separate browser. However, when WebView crashes, it disrupts this integrated experience, causing apps to malfunction.

Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing **Android WebView crash**. These include:

One of the earliest signs of an **Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R Android System WebView crash** is the app freezing. The app may become unresponsive, refusing to respond to your taps or gestures.

- **Unexpected App Closures**

Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. **Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R Android System WebView crashing apps** can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.
