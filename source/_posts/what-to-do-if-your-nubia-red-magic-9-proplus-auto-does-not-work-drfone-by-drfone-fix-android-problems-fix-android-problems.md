## Calls on Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ Go Straight to Voicemail? 12 Fixes

Have you ever experienced incoming calls to your **phone go straight to voicemail** without ringing? It can be frustrating, especially if you’re expecting an important call. It could be due to simple things like turning down the volume or forgetting to turn off the Do Not Disturb mode. In other cases, it might be because you accidentally blocked the caller’s number.

In most cases, incoming calls going to voicemail without ringing are common. However, if it’s happening frequently or for all calls, your phone may have a problem.

This article will discuss why incoming **phone calls go straight to voicemail** and how to fix the problem. We’ll also show you how to use Wondershare Dr.Fone, a powerful Android System Repair tool, to solve such issues. So, if you’re uncertain why that last **call went straight to voicemail**, keep reading, and we’ll cover everything you need to know.

![phone voicemail notification representation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Not Ringing? Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail

If an incoming call to your **cell phone goes straight to voicemail** without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:

1. Turn Off Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode

DND mode is a feature that silences all incoming calls, notifications, and alerts. If DND mode is enabled, your **cell phone goes straight to voicemail** when someone calls. To turn off DND mode, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification settings panel, then tap the **Do not disturb** icon.

![do not disturb mode not enabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-02.jpg)

Here’s an alternative way:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app and go to **Notifications**.
- **Step 2:** Tap **Do not disturb**.

![notifications settings interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-03.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Toggle **Do Not Disturb** offto disable the mode.

2. Turn Off Call Forwarding

One reason calls go **straight to voicemail without ringing** is if you enabled call forwarding. Call forwarding is a feature that redirects incoming calls to another number. To turn off call forwarding:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone Dialer** app on your device, then tap the **menu** icon and select **Settings**.

![phone dial app settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-04.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Navigate to **Supplementary services** > **Call forwarding**.

![call settings supplementary services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-05.jpg)

3. Disable Call Barring

If a phone **call went straight to voicemail**, another possible explanation is the call barring. It is a feature that restricts calls from being made or received on your phone. If activated, it can cause incoming calls to a phone to go straight to voicemail. To turn off call barring on Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ devices:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone Dialer** app, then tap the **menu** icon in the top right corner.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Settings** > **Supplementary services** > **Call barring**, then tap **OK**.
- **Step 3:** Select **Voice call**, then turn off your preferred outgoing and incoming calls. When prompted, enter 0000 as a password.

![call barring settings interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-06.jpg)

4. Update Your Phone’s Software

Sometimes, software bugs can cause problems with incoming calls, which may be why your last incoming **call went straight to voicemail**. If your phone runs outdated software, try updating it to the latest version.

To check for updates, open the **Settings** app and go to **Software update** or **System update**. For a seamless update experience, follow the step-by-step instructions on your mobile screen.

![software update settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-07.jpg)

5. Reset Network Settings

If the incoming calls on your **phone go straight to voicemail**, consider resetting your phone’s network settings. Network settings control how your phone connects to the cellular network. If these settings are not set up correctly, incoming calls may not be able to reach your device.

**Note:** Resetting your network settings will erase any saved Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth pairings, requiring you to re-enter them after the reset is complete.

To reset your network settings on most Android devices:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your smartphone, then tap **System** or **General Management**.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Reset** > **Reset Network Settings** and confirm the action.

![phone reset network settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-08.jpg)

6. Turn Off Bluetooth

When Bluetooth is on, it can interfere with your device’s ability to receive calls, causing them to go **straight to voicemail without ringing**. To turn off [<u> Bluetooth</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-16/fix-wifi-bluetooth-issues-after-upgrading-ios-16.html) on an Android device, you can do one of the following:

- Swipe down from the top of the screen to open the Quick Settingspanel, then tap the **Bluetooth** icon to turn it off.

![bluetooth not enabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-09.jpg)

![turn off bluetooth on settings app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-10.jpg)

It should help ensure that calls come through to your phone instead of going to voicemail.

7. Check Airplane Mode

If turning off Bluetooth didn’t solve the issue, another possible cause could be that your phone is in Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode turns off all wireless connections on your phone, including cellular service, which can cause calls to **dial straight to voicemail**. There are two ways to turn off Airplane mode on Android:

Using the Settings app:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app.
- **Step 2:** Tap **Network & internet**.
- **Step 3:** Toggle off **Airplane mode** or **Flight mode**.

Using the Quick Settings panel:

- **Step 1:** Swipe down from the top of the phone screen to access the **Quick Settings** panel.
- **Step 2:** Look for the **Airplane mode** or **Flight mode** icon, then tap it to turn it off.

![airplane mode on](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-11.jpg)

8. Check Blocked Numbers

**“My boyfriend’s phone goes straight to voicemail** when someone is calling. Any idea why that might be?”

Do you also find yourself asking what does it mean? It could be that he has blocked that phone number. To check this:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone dialer** app.
- **Step 2:** Tap the **menu** icon in the top right corner and select **Settings**.
- **Step 3:** Tap **Block numbers**. If you find the number in the blocked list, remove it to ensure that their calls come through to the phone.

![block numbers on the phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-12.jpg)

If you still have trouble reaching your boyfriend, try calling him from a different number. If your call didn’t go through, you know that he hasn’t blocked your number and that there may be another issue with his phone.

9. Turn Off Google One VPN

If you’re using Google One VPN, try turning it off to see if that fixes the problem. Some users have reported that Google One VPN can cause incoming calls to a **phone to go straight to voicemail**. To turn off Google One VPN:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Google One** app on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+.
- **Step 2:** At the bottom, go to the **Benefits** tab, then tap **View Details** below the **Online protection with a VPN** section.

![google one app interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-13.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Toggle off **Enable VPN**.

![turn off google one vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-14.jpg)

10. Contact Your Carrier

If your **phone calls go straight to voicemail** after trying all the above, contact your carrier for help. They may be able to troubleshoot the problem or determine if there is a service outage in your area.

And if your carrier confirms that there is no service outage or billing-related block, the problem may be with your phone itself. You may need to try resetting your phone to factory settings or taking it to a repair shop.

11. The Caller Used Ringless Voicemail

Ringless voicemail is a service that allows businesses to bypass your phone’s ringtone and send you pre-recorded messages directly to voicemail. Ringless voicemail is often used for marketing purposes. If you think you’re receiving ringless voicemail calls, you can contact the company calling you and ask them to remove you from their list.

![turn on airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android-1.jpg)

## Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings

The third step you’ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.

However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.

1. Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights
2. While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem
3. Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again
4. Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area
5. Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data

## Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode

![wifi not working on android - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg)

If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.

The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+, but the basic process goes as follows;

1. Turn off your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device is completely off
2. Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time
3. You will see the words ‘Safe Mode’ appear on your screen as the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device loads
4. Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works

If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, you’ll know you have a problem with an app or service that’s running on your device. If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.

## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

If you’re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, you’ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.

You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.

1. If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection
2. If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there
3. Whichever method you’re using, try disconnecting your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+. Here’s how to check on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ to make sure everything is correct.

1. Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+
2. Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router
3. Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router
4. Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches

When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.

## Part 7. Fix Android system issues in one click

If none of the solutions above are working, this could indicate a real problem with the firmware and operating system of your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+. Fortunately, a fast solution to get everything working again is to completely repair the software of your phone.

## Part 8. Check the Wi-Fi connectivity on another phone

![android phone not connecting to wifi - connectivity on another phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

When experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, it’s worth noting the problem might not be with your phone, but rather the Wi-Fi network itself. This is why it’s important to make sure you check the connection on another device.

Of course, if you’re already using another phone on your Wi-Fi network, you know this isn’t the case. However, if you’re not sure, here’s what you need to do;

1. Get another Android or iOS phone or tablet
2. Open the Settings menu and connect to the Wi-Fi network you’re having problems with
3. Enter the password and connect to the network
4. Open a web browser on the phone and try loading a web page
5. If the page loads, you know the Wi-Fi network isn’t the problem
6. If the page doesn’t load, you know you’ve got a problem with your Wi-Fi network

## Part 9. Change the password of the Wi-Fi

![android phone not connecting to wifi - password settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-password.jpg)

Each Wi-Fi network router will give the opportunity to choose and change the password you have to let devices connect to your network. It’s important you try changing this because you never know if someone else has accessed your network and could be blocking your device. Here’s how it works;

1. Log onto your computer and open your Wi-Fi settings
2. Depending on the brand and method of your individual router, navigate to the Wi-Fi password settings menu
3. Change the password to something complicated using all available digits and characters
4. Save the password and restart the router to disconnect all devices
5. Now connect your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ to the router using the new password

## Part 10. Reset network settings on Android

![android phone not connecting to wifi - reset network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-network.jpg)

Just like the method above where you’ll be effectively resetting the network settings on your router, if this hasn’t worked, you’ll be able to reset the network settings on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+, hopefully removing the bugs and allowing you to connect.

Here’s how you can do this easily on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+;

1. From the home screen of your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+, open the Settings menu
2. Tap the Backup & Reset option
3. Tap the Reset Network Settings option
4. Tap the Reset Network option
5. If you need to, enter the PIN number or passcode for the Android device, and the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device will confirm the reset has taken place
6. Reconnect your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ to your Wi-Fi network for the changes to take effect

## Part 11. Clear partition cache in recovery mode

![wifi not working on android - clear partition](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-reset-partitioncache.jpg)

As you continue to use your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+, the partition cache will fill up with data your device needs and doesn’t need. However, by clearing your device’s partition cache, you can make clear up some space which should help your device have enough memory to connect to the internet.

1. Turn off your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+
2. Turn it on by holding down the power button, volume button, and home button
3. When your phone vibrates, let go of the Power button, but continue to hold the volume button
4. When a menu is displayed, use the volume buttons to navigate the menu
5. Select the Android System Recovery option, followed by Wipe Cache Partition
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet

## Part 12. Reset factory settings

![wifi not working on android - factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-factory-reset.jpg)

If worse comes to worst, another option you have is to factory reset your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+. As we’ve spoken about above, while using your phone from the day you started using it, your device will fill up with files and data which can become messy and causes bugs.

However, by factory resetting your device, you can start again from the factory default from which you first received it, ultimately clearing the bugs. Make sure you back up your device before proceeding because it will erase your personal files.

1. Open the Settings menu on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+
2. Navigate to System > Advanced > Reset Options
3. Tap the Reset phone option, and enter your PIN code if required
4. Tap Erase Everything
5. Wait for your phone to complete the process
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet
