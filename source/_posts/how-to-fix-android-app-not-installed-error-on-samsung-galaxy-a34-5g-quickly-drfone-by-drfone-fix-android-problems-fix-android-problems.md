## Problem 5: Stuck in sending

Now, here is another annoying problem that doesn’t let Gmail working on Android properly. This problem addresses the situation where users send a mail but it gets stuck on sending. If this is the problem that you are going through, the following solutions will help you.

### Try Alternative Gmail Address

First of all, if Gmail is not working due to stuck in sending issue, we advise you to make use of some other Gmail address to send the mail. If the problem still occurs, jump to the next solution.

### Check Network Connection

As already mentioned, be sure of an active internet connection while working with Gmail. When you are not using a stable connection, it may lead to stuck on sending, Gmail crashing and many other issues. You can fix the issue by doing these three things:

1. Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.
2. Turn off Wi-Fi and then turn it on again after nearly 5 seconds. Do the same with the router. Plug it out and the plug in.
3. Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.

Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.

### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending. If these are not so important, you can remove them and send the mail. Or if it is not possible to send the mail without attachments, compressing the files can be a solution.

## Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue

Many times, the users get the error that says “Account not synced” while they try to work with Gmail. And this is the 6<sup>th</sup> problem we are introducing. The ways mentioned below will assist to get out of the trouble.

### Make Space in the Phone

Go along with this tip and see if it works.

### Check Gmail Sync Settings

As another solution, check Gmail sync settings to get the issue fixed.

If the above method went futile, simply restart your device. Take help of the Power button on your device. Long press it and from the options, restart it. This will hopefully work for you.

## Problem 7: Gmail app running slow

The last problem that you may face is the slow-going Gmail app. In simple words, you may experience that Gmail app is operating extremely slowly. To fix this, following solutions will help you.

### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your Samsung Galaxy A34 5G in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.

### Clear Storage of Device

Usually all the apps start running slow when the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device is not having sufficient space. As the apps need space to function quickly and appropriately, having the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device on low storage can prove to be a bad luck for Gmail. So, make sure you wipe out the items you no longer needed on your device and create some room so that the Gmail responds nicely and won’t be running slow anymore.

### Update Gmail App

As the last tip that will indeed help you is to update the Gmail app. Until you update the app when required, Gmail keeps stopping you from working and you will definitely get frustrated. Therefore, go to Play Store and look for the Gmail update. If it is available, welcome it with smile and bid farewell to the problem of slow running Gmail.

What if your problem still doesn’t get resolved after following these 3 tips? Well! If that is the case, we will again recommend you to make use of an expert one-click tool to flash the stock Android ROM.
