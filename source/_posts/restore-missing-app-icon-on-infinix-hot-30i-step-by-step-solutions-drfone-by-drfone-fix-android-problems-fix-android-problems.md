## Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android

If you've confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don't fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the **missing app icon on Android**.

### 1\. Check hidden apps

How could the **Android phone icon be missing**? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons.

However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:

- **Step 1.** Go to your phone’s Settings.
- **Step 2.** Use the search bar to look for "Hidden app."

### 2\. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer

If your **app icon disappeared on your Android**, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:

### 3\. Re-enable disabled app

**App icons can also disappear on the Android** home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as 'Freezer,' allowing users to temporarily halt the apps.

To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:

- **Step 1**. Open the Apps & Notifications on the Settings.
- **Step 2.** Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the **phone icon disappears on your Android.**
- **Step 3:** In the App Info, tap Enable.

How to reset Android to factory setting:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Android Settings.
- **Step 2:** Select Backup and Reset > Factory data reset. Then, choose to erase all data.
