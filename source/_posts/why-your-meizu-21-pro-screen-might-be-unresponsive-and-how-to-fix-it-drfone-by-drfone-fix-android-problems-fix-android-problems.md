While Meizu 21 Pro devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Meizu 21 Pro device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Meizu 21 Pro, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Meizu 21 Pro device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Meizu 21 Pro F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Meizu 21 Pro device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Meizu 21 Pro Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Meizu 21 Pro device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Meizu 21 Pro device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

Another way to avoid Meizu 21 Pro Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Meizu 21 Pro device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Meizu 21 Pro device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Meizu 21 Pro App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Meizu 21 Pro Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data.
