Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Vivo X100 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Vivo X100, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Vivo X100 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Vivo X100 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Vivo X100 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Vivo X100 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Vivo X100 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Vivo X100 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

Another way to avoid Vivo X100 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Vivo X100 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Vivo X100 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Vivo X100 App Store.
