## Part 1: Why Did My Realme 11 Pro Screen Go Black but Still Works? Common Causes

Experiencing a **cell phone blank screen** is not exclusive to Android or iOS users. A **phone screen not turning on** happens all the time due to several factors that may or may not be out of your control. While they can be frustrating, here are some common causes you should know as to why **your phone screen went black but still works.**

### A Drained Battery

The first thing that comes to mind when your **phone screen suddenly goes black** is you have a drained battery. Even though this is obvious, it’s still important to mention, as this is usually what most people encounter. To fix this problem, plug your smartphone into a charger and wait for your device to turn on again. If it works, then you just prevented a rather annoying experience.

### App Troubles

If your **phone is working, but the screen is black,** there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application. An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.

### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software. This problem suggests that your Realme 11 Pro is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately. If this is the cause, then your device is likely experiencing a critical system error, and you should directly try to reboot your phone.

### Hardware Problem

If you dropped your phone, there’s a high chance the LCD connectors went loose due to the physical impact. If this happened to you, the phone might be working, but the screen is black due to the LCD cable dislodging. Another issue could be your phone got exposed to extreme temperatures. This can also cause a **black screen but your phone is still on.**
