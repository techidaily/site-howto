With a full backup of your Vivo Y36, you can now embark on a mission to fix the error. There are several methods to clear this error. We have outlined three of the most effective solutions here.

Step 1: Go to "Settings" on your device.

Step 2: Access "Apps."

Step 3: Tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner and select "Reset App Preferences."

### Method 3: Clear the cache and data on your device

Step 1: Go to Settings> Applications> Manage Applications and find the Google Services framework.

Step 6: Turn off the Vivo Y36 device and then turn it back on. Go to the Google Services framework again and turn it on to see if the issue has been resolved.

### Method 4: Check Google Sync & Media Storage settings
