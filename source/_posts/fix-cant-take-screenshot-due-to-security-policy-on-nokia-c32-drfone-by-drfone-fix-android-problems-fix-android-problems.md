Some industries and organizations have regulations that need them to protect sensitive data. Financial institutions must protect their customers’ financial information, for example. Disabling screenshots is one way to follow these regulations.

DRM-Protected Content

Prevent Fraud

Scammers and other criminals often use screenshots to commit fraud. For instance, people might send fake screenshots to trick others into sharing personal details or money. Disabling screenshots can help to prevent this type of fraud.

- **Step 1:** Open Chrome on your Nokia C32 and type “chrome://flags” in the address bar.

![chrome experimental flags](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-07.jpg)

Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots

You can download several applications on Google Play Store if you still can’t take a screenshot due to security policy. Some popular third-party screenshot apps include:

- Screenshot Easy

- Screen Master: Screenshot Markup

Third-party screenshot apps often use different methods to capture the screen. These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.

This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.

Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions

Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.

Screen Mirroring

### Fix 6: Check the SD card

If you are still getting the **process system isn’t responding** to Android error, then chances are that there could be an issue with your SD card. Firstly, check if your SD card is working fine or not. If it is corrupted, then get another memory card for your phone. Also, it should have a prominent amount of free storage. You might be facing this issue if the SD card has limited free space.

Also, if you are storing apps on the SD card, then your phone might encounter the process isn’t responding issue whenever you run a respective app. Therefore, you should move apps from your SD card to the phone’s internal memory. To do this, go to your phone’s Settings > Application Manager and select any app. If the app is stored on the SD card, then you will get an option of “Move to devise storage”. Just tap on it and manually move every app to your device storage.
