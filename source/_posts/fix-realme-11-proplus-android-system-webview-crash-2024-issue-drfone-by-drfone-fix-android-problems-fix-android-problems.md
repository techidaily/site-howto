This issue has plagued Android users, causing app crashes, [freezing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-frozen/iphone-keeps-freezing.html), and frustration.

Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing **Android WebView crash**. These include:

Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. **Realme 11 Pro+ Android System WebView crashing apps** can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.
