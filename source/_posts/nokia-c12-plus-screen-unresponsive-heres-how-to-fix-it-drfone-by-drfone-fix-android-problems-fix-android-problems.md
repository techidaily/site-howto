We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Nokia C12 Plus touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Nokia C12 Plus Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Nokia C12 Plus phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Nokia C12 Plus screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Nokia C12 Plus Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Nokia C12 Plus device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Nokia C12 Plus screens to become unresponsive.

These issues can also occur in any Nokia C12 Plus model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Nokia C12 Plus Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Nokia C12 Plus Screen Unresponsive
