### Method 7: Factory Reset your device

If the above steps fail, you might need to perform a factory reset. A factory reset restores the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device to its initial state, which can eliminate many problems, but it will also erase all data. Ensure you back up your important data before proceeding.

### Method 8: Seek Manufacturer Support

If the problem persists after trying the above steps, it could be related to specific device or software issues. It's advisable to contact your device manufacturer's support team for more detailed guidance and assistance.

It is our hope that when faced with this fairly common error, you will not panic. This is a fairly mild issue that can easily be fixed as we have seen above.
