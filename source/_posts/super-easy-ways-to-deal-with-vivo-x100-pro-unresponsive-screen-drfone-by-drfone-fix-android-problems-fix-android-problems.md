A development in arranged availability goes hand-in-hand with the development of cell phones.

Vivo X100 Pro smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Vivo X100 Pro touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Vivo X100 Pro phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen. In this guide, you'll find the information you need to troubleshoot and fix the most common problems reported by Motorola customers.


## **What causes a Vivo X100 Pro Screen to be unresponsive?**

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Vivo X100 Pro device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Vivo X100 Pro smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Vivo X100 Pro 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.
