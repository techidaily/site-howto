This can happen to various models, such as the Realme GT 5, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Realme GT 5 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Realme GT 5 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Realme GT 5 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Realme GT 5 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Realme GT 5 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Realme GT 5 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
