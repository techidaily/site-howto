## Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone

Insufficient storage could be the other reason why for your WhatsApp has stopped.

If this is the case, we suggest you to log out and log in with some another Gmail account.

- Log out by opening “Settings” and tap on “Accounts”.
- Choose your Google account and tap on “REMOVE ACCOUNT”.
