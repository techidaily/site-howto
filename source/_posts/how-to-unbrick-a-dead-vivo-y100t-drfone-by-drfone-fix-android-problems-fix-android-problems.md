This guide teaches effective methods to **unbrick your Vivo Y100t**. The page will also discuss the early warning signs and healthy habits to prolong your Vivo Y100t. Read below to learn more.

## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Vivo Y100t device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Vivo Y100t device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Vivo Y100t freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.
- **Consistent Black Screens.**Experiencing recurring black screens could indicate problems within the operating system. In the long run, this might escalate to bricking.

### Common Reasons for Your Vivo Y100t Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Vivo Y100t devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Failed Updates or Interrupted Installations

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Vivo Y100t device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Vivo Y100t device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.
