## Part 1. Preliminary Reasons For Cellular Network Not Available For Voice Calls

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

### 3\. Network Congestion

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the Itel S23 device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.

### 5\. Battery or Power Issues

In some instances, [<u>insufficient battery power</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-your-phone-battery-health.html) or power-saving modes on devices can cause this issue. They affect the Itel S23 device's capacity to sustain a consistent connection with the cellular network. This consequently causes voice call unavailability.

### Solution 1. Check the Availability of Cellular Networks

Before diving into complex fixes, the first thing to do is to check if nearby cell networks are available and how strong their signals are. It is an essential step when trying to fix the "**Cellular Network Not Available**" error. This basic check ensures your phone is close enough to a working network tower, which matters for staying connected. It allows you to find out the availability of nearby cellular networks.

Moreover, with it, you can ensure your device is connected to a reliable network. This preliminary check sets the foundation for further troubleshooting.

![checking network availability](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cellular-network-not-available-for-voice-calls-android-2.jpg)

### Solution 2. Check the Airplane Mode of the Smartphone

Another crucial step in resolving this error involves ensuring that the Airplane Mode is disabled. This mode, when activated, disables all wireless connections. It also includes cellular networks, which could lead to connectivity issues. Follow these simple steps to check and disable Airplane Mode on your device:

**Instructions:** Swipe down on your phone's screen from the top to access the Notification Panel, unveiling the Quick Settings tiles. Search for the airplane-shaped icon; if Airplane Mode is active, the icon will be highlighted or shown in a distinct color. Tap the Airplane Mode to turn off the Airplane Mode on your Android.

### Solution 3. Selecting the Network Operator of the Itel S23 device

In certain instances, manually selecting your network operator can help. It effectively resolves the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error on your Itel S23.

Follow these steps to select your network operator manually:

- **Step 1.** Access "Settings" on your Itel S23, then tap on "Connections." From there, navigate to "Mobile Networks" and proceed by selecting "Network Operators."

### Solution 5. Enable Roaming Settings

There are situations where you're in an area with weak or no coverage from your primary network provider. In such a case, enabling roaming settings on your Itel S23 can sometimes resolve the issue at hand. Enabling roaming allows your device to connect to partner networks. This extends your coverage beyond your home network's reach. Follow these steps to enable roaming settings on your Itel S23:

- **Step 1.** Start by accessing your device's Settings and tapping the "Connections" option. Here, scroll downward to press "Mobile Networks."

## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Itel S23 device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Itel S23 device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Itel S23 freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Itel S23 device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Itel S23 device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.

If you are struggling with the same issue and want to know what to do when Android Settings is not responding, this post will help you. We have explained everything in detail along with the solutions. So, scroll down and get things sorted.

## Part 1: Clear the cache of Settings and Google Play Service

It is possible that the corrupted cache files are responsible for this error. Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:

1. Open “Settings” on your Itel S23 and choose “Apps & Notifications”/”Apps”/”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).
2. In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.
3. Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.

![settings crashing - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg)

Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”. Therefore, go accordingly without getting confused.

## Part 2: Clear the Android phone’s RAM and retry

As the next tip, we would like to suggest you clear your device’s RAM by ceasing the running apps in the background. RAM, if at the increased level, is responsible for the Itel S23 device’s freezing, poor performance, and most probably is the reason behind crashing Settings. Also, if the apps in the background keep running, they might conflict with the Settings and stop it to perform properly. Therefore clearing RAM is important when Android Settings is not responding. Here is how to do it.

1. Firstly, you need to go to the Recent apps screen. For this, long-press the Home key.  
    Note: Please note that different devices have different ways to go to the Recent apps screen. Do it according to the Itel S23 device you own.
2. Now, swipe the apps and tap on the clear option. You will be able to notice the amount of RAM cleared

![settings crashing - clear ram](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-ram.jpg)

## Part 3: Uninstall the Google update
