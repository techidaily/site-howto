## Part 3: 10 Common Fixes When Google Play Services Won’t Update

### Method 1. Restart your Android and try to update again

In most cases, restarting the Oppo A18 device can simply do the trick. When you restart the Oppo A18 device, most of the issues get eliminated making the Oppo A18 device perform better than before. Also, it is all about RAM. While you restart your device, the RAM gets cleared. As a result, the apps work properly. So, in the first place, we would like you to restart your Oppo A18 when you cannot update Google Play Services. Once restarted, try to update again and see if the results are positive.

### Method 2. Uninstall Google Play Services Updates and Reattempt the Update

Uninstalling previous Google Play Services updates resolves conflicts and errors, often addressing the issue of updates. This process clears potential obstacles, enabling a successful update of Google Play Services. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your device's "Settings."
2. Scroll down and select "Apps" or "App Manager."
3. Locate and tap on "Google Play Services."
4. Depending on your device and Android version, you might need to tap on "App info" or "Storage."
5. Look for the option to "Uninstall updates." This will revert Google Play Services to its original version.
6. Confirm the action when prompted.
7. Once the updates are uninstalled, go back to the Google Play Store.
8. Search for "Google Play Services" using the search bar at the top.
9. If an update is available, you'll see the option to "Update." Tap on it to start the update process.

### Method 4. Google account and re-add it

Go to your device's Settings, select Accounts or Users, and remove your Google account. Restart your device and add the account again. This process can refresh the connection and resolve update issues.

### Method 5. Uninstall unnecessary apps

As we mentioned above, due to a lot of apps being installed at the same time, the issue can crop up. And hence, if the above solution didn’t help, you can try to uninstall the apps that you don’t need currently. We hope this works. But if not, you can go to the next fix.

### Method 6. Clear Google Play Services cache

If still you cannot update Google Play Services, clearing cache can solve your problem. We also stated this in the beginning as the reason. If you don’t know, cache holds the app’s data temporarily so that it can remember the information when you next open the app. Many times, old cache files get corrupted. And clearing cache can also help in saving storage space on your device. For these reasons, you need to clear cache of Google Play Services to get rid of the problem.

Here is how to clear Google Play Services cache:

![set correct date and time](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/clear-cache.jpg)

- Launch “Settings” on your phone and go to “Apps & Notifications” or “Application” or “Application Manager”.
- Now, from all the apps’ list, choose “Google Play Services”.
- On opening it, tap “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.

### Method 7. Boot into download mode to clear cache of whole phone

If unfortunately, things are still the same, we would like to recommend you wipe the cache of the whole device to fix the issue. This is an advanced method to solve issues and is helpful when the Oppo A18 device is facing any flaws or malfunctions. For this, you need to go to the download mode or recovery mode of your device. Every device has its own steps for this. Like in some, you need to simultaneously press the “Power” and “Volume Down” keys. While in some, the “Power” and both “Volume” keys work.

This is how it works when Google Play Services can't be installed on your device:

![google play services not installing - wipe cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/wipe-data.jpg)

- Turn off the Oppo A18 device to begin with and then follow the steps for recovery mode.
- On the recovery screen, use the “Volume” buttons for scrolling up and down and go to “Wipe cache partition”.
