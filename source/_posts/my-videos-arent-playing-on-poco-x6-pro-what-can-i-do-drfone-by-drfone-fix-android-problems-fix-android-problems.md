![person holding their android with black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-1.jpg)

There’s a reason Android holds over two-thirds of the mobile operating system market share. It’s a powerful OS that gives you the utmost freedom and flexibility, allowing you to customize your phone to suit your needs.

However, regardless of the capabilities of Android phones and the features that come with their OS, just like any other smartphone, they’re prone to glitches and annoying issues – especially with their video files.

You may encounter **videos not playing on your Poco X6 Pro** more frequently than you like. Whether it’s video files you’ve recorded using your phone or files you’ve downloaded, this glitch can get pretty annoying pretty fast. Fortunately, there are several solutions you could try to fix it.

See what you can do if **videos won’t play on your Android.**

## Why Are My Videos Not Playing On Android?

![person recording cityscape using their android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-2.jpg)

Considering how most smartphone manufacturers tend to emphasize the unbelievable quality of their cameras, perfect night modes, seamless slow-motion recordings, superb resolution, and more, you’d expect all images and videos to function flawlessly on your Android. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case.

Occasionally, you could find that the videos you access from your gallery won’t play, sending you the message that “video cannot be played” or “can’t play video.” Other times, you might find that YouTube videos won’t load correctly or your downloaded videos won’t open in your media player.

There could be a wide variety of reasons that is happening, including:

- Corrupted video
- Corrupted SD card
- Outdated media player
- Outdated OS
- Incomplete download from the source
- Low storage
- Video downloaded from a suspicious source

An array of hardware and software issues could lead to you being unable to play videos on your Android. However, that doesn’t mean you should immediately send your device for repairs or delete the videos that won’t play. There might be a few better solutions you could try.

## What You Can Do if Your Videos Aren’t Playing On Android Phone

Since there are many reasons for having problems with videos not playing on your Android, you could also try many solutions.

### 1. Do a Factory Reset

![person holding a black android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-3.jpg)

While a factory reset shouldn’t always be the first solution you go to, it can usually prove to be the most effective one.

A factory reset, aka a master reset or a hard reset, returns all your software configurations to the original state when the phone was first manufactured. In the process, all your data is lost – any photos and videos you have on your phone and the apps you’ve installed will be deleted. You’ll be logged out of all your accounts and won’t have access to your message history, contacts, and more.

While it seems like an extreme step, it can help fix any video issues you might encounter due to software bugs.

Though there could be slight variations between different phones, you can usually perform a factory reset by going to **Settings > General Management > Reset > Factory data reset > Reset.**

![factory reset on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-4.jpg)

### 2. Restart Your Poco X6 Pro

While a factory reset is all but guaranteed to fix the issues you’re encountering with your videos, sometimes a simple restart might do the trick just fine. A restart works by clearing your RAM (Random Access Memory).

In a nutshell, RAM stores short-term data that helps your processor complete tasks quickly. This data is always easily accessible, and it’s what helps your phone quickly open webpages and apps you’ve recently used.

Over time, however, your RAM can get filled with unnecessary data and data fragments, which, in turn, can confuse your processor.

Restarting your phone will clear your RAM and potentially eliminate any data fragments causing your videos to be unplayable.

### 3. Check the Video Format

As a general rule of thumb, the videos you capture should be in a format your device supports. However, the videos you’ve downloaded might not be. That’s why checking the files’ video format before trying other possible fixes is in your best interest.

If the format isn’t supported, installing the right video player with the necessary compatibility is the most straightforward fix. Some of the most popular video players for Android include VLC for Android, GOM Player, MX Player, Bsplayer, and RealPlayer. You can easily find all of them in the Google Play Store.

### 4. Check the Internet Connection

![pull-down bar on android showing wifi is turned off](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-5.jpg)

If you’re having problems playing downloaded or online videos, check your internet connection to see if there’s an issue there. If your internet’s down, any downloaded videos might not have downloaded correctly, and any online videos that haven’t been loaded will not play.

Make sure that you turn the Airplane mode off and your Wi-Fi on. Check the connection and test your internet speed to see if everything works properly.

You might need a network reset if your phone can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network. The path might differ between Android devices, but you should be able to find the option for a network reset at the exact location of your factory reset. Go to **Settings > General Management > Reset > Reset Network settings > Reset settings**.

![android network reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-6.jpg)

### 5. Clear the Cache

The cache stores a copy of your most commonly used data, helping decrease loading time and improve your phone’s performance. However, too much cache data can take up too much space and cause data corruption, preventing you from accessing some of your apps.

On average, you should clear your phone’s cache every few months to ensure that everything runs smoothly. If you encounter issues with your videos not playing on Android, clearing the cache could be just the fix you need.

To clear the cache from your apps, you’ll want to go to **Settings > Apps.** From there, select the app you want to remove the cache from, scroll down to **Storage**, then choose **Clear Cache**.

![clear cache on android apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-7.jpg)

### 6. Update Android OS

An outdated Android OS is usually the culprit behind many bugs and glitches you may encounter on your phone. It can prevent you from playing video files, accessing apps, taking photos, and more. It can lead to data corruption and loss, expose you to malware and cyberattacks, and compromise phone performance.

Regularly updating your OS to its latest version is always in your best interest. It can solve the problem of your videos not playing and protect you and your sensitive data.

### 7. Repair Your Android OS

![person holding a phone with black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-8.jpg)

You might already have the latest version of Android OS, but that still doesn’t mean your OS is functioning as it should. Maybe your phone was interrupted while downloading or installing the new OS version. Maybe your phone had underlying OS issues, or you accidentally downloaded files you shouldn’t have. Whatever the case is, if your videos don’t play due to an OS problem, you’ll need to repair your OS.

The best way to do it is with a reliable Android OS repair solution like Wondershare Dr.Fone.

Remember that repairing your device with Wondershare Dr.Fone might result in data loss. Back up all your essential data before fixing your OS using this software to stay safe.

### 8. Update the Video App

Sometimes, it’s not the outdated OS version causing issues but rather the out-of-date video app. Like OS updates, app and other software updates often contain fixes for common problems and security patches. Not every update is there simply to introduce new features.

To check whether you’re using the latest version of your video player, go to **Settings > Apps**. Find your video player app, tap it, and scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the version installed on your phone.

![android app version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-14.jpg)

### 9. Clear Cookies and Browsing Data

If online videos are causing problems, not your recorded or downloaded ones, you might be due for a quick cookie and browsing data clearing.

Cookies are usually there to improve the user experience, allowing you to load websites faster and enjoy improved performance. However, if your cookies and browsing data occupy too much space, they could pose problems.

You’ll first need to launch your mobile browser to clear cookies and browsing data. If you’re using Google Chrome, the process is simple and streamlined. Tap the three dots in the upper right corner and go to **Settings**. From there, go to **Privacy and security > Clear browsing data > Clear data**.

### 10. Reinstall Video Apps

If you still have issues with videos not playing on your Poco X6 Pro, you could try deleting and reinstalling your video apps. Sometimes, simply updating the video app might still retain the glitch causing problems. However, if you delete it in its entirety and then install it again, the issue should be gone.

To uninstall the video app on your Android, go to **Settings > Apps**. Locate the app you want to delete, then tap **Uninstall** at the bottom of your screen.

To reinstall it again, go to the Google Play Store, search for the video app you want to have, then click **Install**.

Whatever the case is, don’t despair. There’s usually a solution that can fix the problem and ensure your device works as expected.

## Fix App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Problem on Poco X6 Pro

Mobile applications are important for smooth operations when it comes to smartphones. They offer convenience, entertainment, and functionality at your fingertips. However, encountering the "**App Not Available in Your Country Play Store**" issue can be frustrating. It can quickly dampen the excitement of discovering a new app.

This is mainly due to geographical restrictions that are often imposed by developers. It poses a hurdle for users eager to access a particular application. However, there is no need to worry, as this article will help you in resolving this issue. It will delve into effective strategies and solutions to ensure the unavailability of an app is no longer an obstacle.

## Part 1: Reasons Behind the App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Issue

Encountering the "**Google Play App Not Available in Your Country**" issue can feel like hitting a roadblock. This restriction hampers your ability to explore and use valuable apps. It can also disrupt the smooth functioning of your daily digital activities. Before going for solutions, it is crucial to understand the reasons causing this restriction in installing apps on smartphones:

### 1\. Regional Restrictions

One of the primary culprits behind this issue is the regional restrictions imposed by developers. Developers often roll out their apps gradually across different regions. It is done to adhere to legal and licensing requirements. This staggered release strategy ensures compliance with local laws. Moreover, it guarantees a smooth user experience tailored to specific geographical locations.

### 2\. Licensing and Legal Constraints

Licensing agreements and legal constraints play an important role when it comes to the accessibility of apps. Developers may encounter licensing issues. This can prevent them from offering their apps in certain regions. It is due to copyright, trademark, or other legal considerations. Navigating the complex web of international laws and agreements is a big hassle. It becomes a determining factor in the availability of apps on the Play Store.

### 3\. Localization Challenges

Apps are often designed with specific markets in mind. These incorporate language, cultural, and regulatory considerations to enhance user experience. The absence of proper localization can render an app incompatible with specific regions. It includes factors such as adapting the app for different languages, currencies, and cultural nuances. This can result in the app being excluded from the **Play Store app not available in your country.**

### 4\. Device and OS Compatibility

The compatibility between the app, the user's device, and its OS is another factor that contributes to this issue. Developers might restrict their app availability to certain devices or OS versions. It can restrict access for users whose devices or OS do not meet the app's requirements. This technical limitation adds another layer to the complexity of app availability.

### 5\. Political and Economic Factors

In some instances, political tensions or economic considerations can also be a factor. It may influence the accessibility of apps in certain countries. Geo-political factors, trade sanctions, or economic conditions can impact the distribution of apps. This leads developers to exclude specific regions from their app's availability.

The right app can make a major difference in work efficiency or personal enjoyment. That's why facing the "**Play Store app not available in your country**" issue can be frustrating. The positive aspect is that many solutions exist for addressing this issue. Presented below are the top 4 approaches to resolving this matter:

### Method 1: Change Your Google Play Store Country

One of the most direct ways to address this issue is by manually adjusting your Google Play Store country settings. Google allows users to change their country or region. Remember that you can only do it once a year. To utilize this approach, it's essential to reside in the specified country. The other option is to provide a payment method originating from that particular region. Below is a detailed walkthrough for this procedure:

- **Step 1.** Launch the Google Play Store on your Poco X6 Pro and tap the “Profile” icon from the top right corner. Here, choose "Settings" and follow on to tap "General."

### Method 2: Use a Reliable VPN

Confronting the message "**This app is not accessible in your country" on the Play Store**? Employing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be an effective strategy. It allows you to virtually transcend geographical restrictions. A VPN masks your actual location by routing your internet connection through servers in different regions.

You can utilize a reliable VPN to access the Play Store as though you were in a region where the desired app is accessible. Follow this step-by-step guide to address this concern:

- **Step 1.** Access the Google Play Store and download a reliable VPN for the procedure. Open the VPN you download and connect to the country of your choice. Once you have connected your device’s IP to another country using the VPN, continue to your home screen.

### Method 3: Download an APK File

This method involves installing the application manually, bypassing the Google Play Store. Follow these sequential instructions to download and install an APK file:

- **Step 1.** Before starting, ensure that you have enabled the installation from unknown sources. Afterward, find a reliable website and search for your targeted apps.

## Part 1: Clear the cache of Settings and Google Play Service

It is possible that the corrupted cache files are responsible for this error. Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:

1. Open “Settings” on your Poco X6 Pro and choose “Apps & Notifications”/”Apps”/”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).
2. In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.
3. Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.

![settings crashing - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg)

Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”. Therefore, go accordingly without getting confused.

## Part 2: Clear the Android phone’s RAM and retry

As the next tip, we would like to suggest you clear your device’s RAM by ceasing the running apps in the background. RAM, if at the increased level, is responsible for the Poco X6 Pro device’s freezing, poor performance, and most probably is the reason behind crashing Settings.

Here is how to do it.

1. Firstly, you need to go to the Recent apps screen. For this, long-press the Home key.  
    Note: Please note that different devices have different ways to go to the Recent apps screen. Do it according to the Poco X6 Pro device you own.
2. Now, swipe the apps and tap on the clear option. You will be able to notice the amount of RAM cleared

![settings crashing - clear ram](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-ram.jpg)

## Part 3: Uninstall the Google update

Uninstalling Google Play Store updates has also responded well to many users. It has worked in the case of the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” error. So, we would also like to suggest you use this tip if the others don’t work. Here are the steps to be followed for this.

1. Open “Settings” on your Android and tap on “Application manager” or “Apps” or “Application.
2. Now, head to all the apps and select “Google Play Store” from there.
