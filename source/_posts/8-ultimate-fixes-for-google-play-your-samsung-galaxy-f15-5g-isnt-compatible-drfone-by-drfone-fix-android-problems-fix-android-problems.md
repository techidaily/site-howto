## Part 1: Reasons Behind Your Device Isn’t Compatible With This Version Play Store

Encountering the frustrating "**your device isn’t compatible with this version Google Play**" error can be disruptive. That's why it is essential to go through the underlying reasons causing this compatibility issue:

### 1\. Outdated Operating System Firmware

One of the primary culprits behind the compatibility error is [<u>outdated OS firmware</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html). App developers release updates to keep up with the latest features and security patches. That's why an obsolete OS version on your device may render it incompatible with the newer app versions available on the Google Play Store.

### 2\. Insufficient Hardware Requirements

Each application has specific hardware prerequisites that your device needs to fulfill. In case your smartphone does not meet the required specifications, you won't be able to utilize the app. Thus, Google Play Store may restrict access to certain applications, citing compatibility issues.

### 3\. Corrupted Cache Files

Cache files are designed to enhance the speed and efficiency of app loading. Yet, they can sometimes become corrupt. When this occurs, it disrupts the app's normal operation. Clearing these corrupted cache files is often a crucial step.

### 4\. Geographic Restrictions

In certain cases, app developers or Google Play itself may impose geographic restrictions. This could lead to compatibility issues if your device is located in an area where the app is restricted. Understanding the geographical availability of an app is vital in finding the root cause.

### 4\. Beta Versions and Unstable Releases

Engaging with beta versions or unstable releases of an app can result in compatibility issues. These versions are typically in the testing phase. That's why their compatibility with a wide range of devices may not be guaranteed. If you find yourself facing compatibility errors, it's worth checking if you are in a beta program.

### Option 2: Restart Your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G

This method may seem simple, but it can be the most effective solution to your problem. Here is how you restart most smartphones available in the market.

****Step 1:**** Press and hold down the ****power key**** on your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G until the ****power menu**** appears.

****Step 2:**** Select ****Restart**** on your phone's screen. It will initiate a reboot of your device.

**Tip:**

If your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G is unresponsive to the usual restart method because a ****part of the phone screen is not working****, try a forced restart by holding the ****power button**** for at least 10 seconds.

### Option 3: Check If Stuck Samsung Galaxy F15 5G Phone Only Appears in Specific Mobile Apps

If the previous method did not work, check if the ****stuck pixels on the phone**** only appear in specific mobile apps. Sometimes, stuck pixels may only show up when using particular apps, so identifying which app is causing the issue can help pinpoint the problem.

****Step 1:**** Put your smartphone in ****Safe Mode****.

**Note:**

Visit the help page for your device's manufacturer to learn how to activate and deactivate safe mode. Safe mode disables all downloaded programs momentarily.

![safe mode on the android screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-08.jpg)

****Step 2:**** Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the ****stuck pixel phone**** display. Next, turn off ****Safe Mode****.

****Step 3:**** To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.

### Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset

Consider a factory data reset if the previous options did not resolve your issue with stuck or dead pixels on the phone screen. This process will erase all data from your device, so remember to back up any important information before proceeding.

****Step 1:**** Open the ****Settings**** application.

**Step 2:** Choose ****System > Reset > Erase all data (factory reset) > Erase all data****.

![smartphone reset settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-09.jpg)

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

Aside from the methods and tools discussed for fixing ****dead pixels on phone screen****s and ****stuck pixels on the phone****, you may still have some questions regarding the issues. Whether you are dealing with a single stuck pixel or a cluster of dead pixels, this section aims to provide you with helpful insights.

### 1\. Can Dead Samsung Galaxy F15 5Gs Fix Themselves?

No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Samsung Galaxy F15 5Gs Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

### 3\. Why Are Dead Samsung Galaxy F15 5Gs Spreading on My Samsung Galaxy F15 5G?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Samsung Galaxy F15 5Gs Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Samsung Galaxy F15 5G devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.
