Encountering the frustrating "**your device isn’t compatible with this version Google Play**" error can be disruptive. That's why it is essential to go through the underlying reasons causing this compatibility issue:

### 1\. Outdated Operating System Firmware

One of the primary culprits behind the compatibility error is [<u>outdated OS firmware</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html). App developers release updates to keep up with the latest features and security patches. That's why an obsolete OS version on your device may render it incompatible with the newer app versions available on the Google Play Store.

### 2\. Insufficient Hardware Requirements

Each application has specific hardware prerequisites that your device needs to fulfill. In case your smartphone does not meet the required specifications, you won't be able to utilize the app. Thus, Google Play Store may restrict access to certain applications, citing compatibility issues.
