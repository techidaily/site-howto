Android WebView is an integral component of Android apps, acting as the invisible engine that renders web content within these apps. It allows users to seamlessly browse websites, watch videos, and interact with web pages without switching to a separate browser.

Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing **Android WebView crash**. These include:

- **App Freezing**
