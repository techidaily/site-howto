### Reason 2. Problematic App

**Solution:** While in Safe Mode, observe if the Poco C55 device boots up properly. If it successfully boots, it suggests that a third-party application is causing the problem. To pinpoint the problematic app, uninstall recently added apps individually and restart the Poco C55 device after each removal. This process helps pinpoint the problematic app causing the hang during startup.
