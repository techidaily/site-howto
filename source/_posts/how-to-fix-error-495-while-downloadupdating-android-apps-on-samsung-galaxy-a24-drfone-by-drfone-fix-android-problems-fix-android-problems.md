In the following sections, we're diving into the **"why is My Samsung Galaxy A24 offline"** dilemma that many Android users face. We'll break down the possible reasons behind this common issue and guide you through simple steps on how to fix it. By the end of the article, you’ll be able to get back to smooth internet surfing on your Samsung Galaxy A24. Let’s get started.

## Part 1: Why Does My Samsung Galaxy A24 Say Offline?

When you encounter the “offline” error message, it can disrupt your usual smartphone activities. Suddenly, you find yourself unable to browse the internet, send or receive emails, or stay connected through instant messages.

It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Samsung Galaxy A24 showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Samsung Galaxy A24. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

2. **Internet connection issues**

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My Samsung Galaxy A24 offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.

3. **Glitches or bugs**

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Samsung Galaxy A24 can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

4. **Firewall restrictions**

In some cases, a firewall on your Samsung Galaxy A24 might be overly restrictive, preventing the Samsung Galaxy A24 device from establishing a connection to the internet. This security measure, intended to protect your device, can sometimes go overboard and disrupt normal online functionality.

Now, you have understood the potential causes as the first step toward resolving the issue. Next, we'll guide you through the process of troubleshooting and getting your Samsung Galaxy A24 back online.

We will discuss in this article why your Chrome is crashing on Android and the potential solutions to do away with the problem. Please read the article attentively and know what helps you best.

As a result, it will obviously get stopped midway. Therefore, we suggest you to close the tabs which are opened. And once you do that, exit the app and then launch it again.

## Part 2: Too much memory used

When Chrome or any other app keeps running on the background, issues like “Unfortunately Chrome has stopped” are likely to occur. Moreover, the opened apps will eat the memory of your device. Hence, as the next solution, it is suggested that the Chrome should be closed by force quitting and then you need to try to launch it again to work. See if it works or still Chrome is not responding.

1\. Simply tap on the Home button twice to get on the recent apps screen. Please note that the button may vary to reach the screen. Please check once and move accordingly.

## Part 3: Chrome cache overflowing

While using any app for long, the temporary files for those gets collected in the form of cache. And when cache is not getting cleared, one may face the freezing, crashing or sluggish apps. And this could also be the cause why your Chrome keeps stopping. Hence, the following steps will show you how to clear cache and make Chrome work as before.

1\. Open “Settings” and go to “Apps & Notifications”.

2\. Look for “Chrome” and tap on it.

3\. Go to “Storage” and click on “Clear Cache”.
