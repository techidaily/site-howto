## Common Causes of Nokia C22 Screen Unresponsiveness

While Nokia C22 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Nokia C22 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Nokia C22, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Nokia C22 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Nokia C22 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Nokia C22 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Nokia C22 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Nokia C22 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Nokia C22 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Nokia C22 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Nokia C22 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent Nokia C22 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Nokia C22 device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid Nokia C22 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Nokia C22 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Nokia C22 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Nokia C22 App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Nokia C22 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data. With features such as System Repair and Data Backup & Restore, you can quickly diagnose and fix software issues that may cause unresponsiveness and safely back up important data to prevent loss in case of device damage or malfunction.

### Conclusion

Nokia C22 Screen unresponsiveness can be a frustrating issue to deal with, but there are solutions available. Force restarting the Nokia C22 device, checking for software updates, using Dr. Fone Repair, and contacting customer service are all effective ways to solve the problem. However, it's also important to understand the possible causes of the issue, such as soft-bricking or equipment wearing out, and take preventative measures, such as updating your phone on time and avoiding malware. These tips can help prevent Nokia C22 Screen unresponsiveness and keep your device running smoothly.

## Part 1. Preliminary Reasons For Cellular Network Not Available For Voice Calls

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

### 3\. Network Congestion

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the Nokia C22 device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.

### 5\. Battery or Power Issues

In some instances, [<u>insufficient battery power</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-your-phone-battery-health.html) or power-saving modes on devices can cause this issue. They affect the Nokia C22 device's capacity to sustain a consistent connection with the cellular network. This consequently causes voice call unavailability.
