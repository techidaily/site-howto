### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 1: Head to the “Settings” of your Motorola Defy 2 and then opt for “Wireless and Networks” followed by “WLAN/WiFi”.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 3: Depending on your Motorola Defy 2 model, look for “IP Settings” and tap on it. Now, switch the “DHCP” to “Static”.

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.
