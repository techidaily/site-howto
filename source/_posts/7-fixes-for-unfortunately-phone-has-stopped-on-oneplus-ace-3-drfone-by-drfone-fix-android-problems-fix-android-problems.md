### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.
