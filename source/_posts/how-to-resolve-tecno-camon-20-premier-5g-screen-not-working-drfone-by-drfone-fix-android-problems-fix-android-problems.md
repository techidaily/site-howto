Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:

1. Open “Settings” on your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G and choose “Apps & Notifications”/”Apps”/”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).
2. In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.
3. Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.

![settings crashing - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg)

Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”. Therefore, go accordingly without getting confused.

## Part 2: Clear the Android phone’s RAM and retry
