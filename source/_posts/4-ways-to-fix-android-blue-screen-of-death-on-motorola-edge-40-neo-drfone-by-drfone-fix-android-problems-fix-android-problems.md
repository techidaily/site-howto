## The Common Solutions To Solve A Motorola Edge 40 Neo Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Motorola Edge 40 Neo screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

### 1. Restart The Device

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Motorola Edge 40 Neo black screen problem.
