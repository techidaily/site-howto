This can happen to various models, such as the Vivo S17e, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Vivo S17e device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Vivo S17e F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Vivo S17e device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Vivo S17e Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Vivo S17e device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Vivo S17e device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

Another way to avoid Vivo S17e Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Vivo S17e device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness.
