## What Causes A Oppo K11x Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Oppo K11x phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Oppo K11x screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Oppo K11x Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Oppo K11x device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Oppo K11x screens to become unresponsive.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Oppo K11x Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Oppo K11x Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Oppo K11x screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Oppo K11x model.

### 1.Â Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Oppo K11x black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Oppo K11x's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Oppo K11x device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Oppo K11x device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Oppo K11xlogo appears.

### 2.Â Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Oppo K11x device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Oppo K11x device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Oppo K11x device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3.Â Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Oppo K11x device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Oppo K11x device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Oppo K11x Y2 and Oppo K11x 5A.

![restart android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android.jpg)

![turn on airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android-1.jpg)

## Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings

The third step youâ€™ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Oppo K11x. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and theyâ€™re working fine, you know this isnâ€™t the problem.

However, if youâ€™ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know youâ€™ve got a router problem. Hereâ€™s how to solve it.

1. Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights
2. While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem
3. Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again
4. Call up your internet provider to see if thereâ€™s an internet connection issue in your area
5. Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Oppo K11x is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data

## Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode

![wifi not working on android - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg)

If youâ€™re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Oppo K11x itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.

The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Oppo K11x, but the basic process goes as follows;

1. Turn off your Oppo K11x by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Oppo K11x device is completely off
2. Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time
3. You will see the words â€˜Safe Modeâ€™ appear on your screen as the Oppo K11x device loads
4. Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works

If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, youâ€™ll know you have a problem with an app or service thatâ€™s running on your device. If this is the case, youâ€™ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.

## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

If youâ€™re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, youâ€™ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Oppo K11x itself, especially if youâ€™re using an older device, or if youâ€™re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.

You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.

1. If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Oppo K11x device drivers are up to date, and if youâ€™re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection
2. If youâ€™re using a router adapter, make sure itâ€™s set up properly, and your Oppo K11x is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there
3. Whichever method youâ€™re using, try disconnecting your Oppo K11x and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Oppo K11x needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure theyâ€™re matched to the network youâ€™re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Oppo K11x. Hereâ€™s how to check on your Oppo K11x to make sure everything is correct.

1. Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Oppo K11x
2. Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router
3. Find the router name (SSID) and make sure itâ€™s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router
4. Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches

When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, youâ€™ll know this wasnâ€™t the problem.

## Part 7. Fix Android system issues in one click

If none of the solutions above are working, this could indicate a real problem with the firmware and operating system of your Oppo K11x. Fortunately, a fast solution to get everything working again is to completely repair the software of your phone.

## Part 8. Check the Wi-Fi connectivity on another phone

![android phone not connecting to wifi - connectivity on another phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

When experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, itâ€™s worth noting the problem might not be with your phone, but rather the Wi-Fi network itself. This is why itâ€™s important to make sure you check the connection on another device.

Of course, if youâ€™re already using another phone on your Wi-Fi network, you know this isnâ€™t the case. However, if youâ€™re not sure, hereâ€™s what you need to do;

## Part 9. Change the password of the Wi-Fi

![android phone not connecting to wifi - password settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-password.jpg)

Each Wi-Fi network router will give the opportunity to choose and change the password you have to let devices connect to your network. Itâ€™s important you try changing this because you never know if someone else has accessed your network and could be blocking your device. Hereâ€™s how it works;

1. Log onto your computer and open your Wi-Fi settings
2. Depending on the brand and method of your individual router, navigate to the Wi-Fi password settings menu
3. Change the password to something complicated using all available digits and characters
4. Save the password and restart the router to disconnect all devices

## Part 10. Reset network settings on Android

Hereâ€™s how you can do this easily on your Oppo K11x;

1. From the home screen of your Oppo K11x, open the Settings menu
2. Tap the Backup & Reset option
3. Tap the Reset Network Settings option
4. Tap the Reset Network option
5. If you need to, enter the PIN number or passcode for the Android device, and the Oppo K11x device will confirm the reset has taken place
6. Reconnect your Oppo K11x to your Wi-Fi network for the changes to take effect

As you continue to use your Oppo K11x, the partition cache will fill up with data your device needs and doesnâ€™t need. However, by clearing your deviceâ€™s partition cache, you can make clear up some space which should help your device have enough memory to connect to the internet.

1. Turn off your Oppo K11x
2. Turn it on by holding down the power button, volume button, and home button
3. When your phone vibrates, let go of the Power button, but continue to hold the volume button
4. When a menu is displayed, use the volume buttons to navigate the menu
5. Select the Android System Recovery option, followed by Wipe Cache Partition
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet

If worse comes to worst, another option you have is to factory reset your Oppo K11x. As weâ€™ve spoken about above, while using your phone from the day you started using it, your device will fill up with files and data which can become messy and causes bugs.

However, by factory resetting your device, you can start again from the factory default from which you first received it, ultimately clearing the bugs. Make sure you back up your device before proceeding because it will erase your personal files.

1. Open the Settings menu on your Oppo K11x
2. Navigate to System > Advanced > Reset Options
3. Tap the Reset phone option, and enter your PIN code if required
4. Tap Erase Everything
5. Wait for your phone to complete the process
6. Restart your device and connect to the internet
