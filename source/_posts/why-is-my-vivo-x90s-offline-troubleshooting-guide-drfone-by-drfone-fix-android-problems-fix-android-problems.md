## Why Is My Vivo X90S Offline? Troubleshooting Guide

Ever had your Vivo X90S claim it's offline, leaving you scratching your head about where it went wrong? We get it; it's confusing. That's why this article is here to untangle the mystery.

In the following sections, we're diving into the **"why is My Vivo X90S offline"** dilemma that many Android users face. We'll break down the possible reasons behind this common issue and guide you through simple steps on how to fix it. By the end of the article, you’ll be able to get back to smooth internet surfing on your Vivo X90S. Let’s get started.

## Part 1: Why Does My Vivo X90S Say Offline?

When you encounter the “offline” error message, it can disrupt your usual smartphone activities. Suddenly, you find yourself unable to browse the internet, send or receive emails, or stay connected through instant messages.

It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Vivo X90S showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Vivo X90S. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

2. **Internet connection issues**

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My Vivo X90S offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.

3. **Glitches or bugs**

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Vivo X90S can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

4. **Firewall restrictions**

In some cases, a firewall on your Vivo X90S might be overly restrictive, preventing the Vivo X90S device from establishing a connection to the internet. This security measure, intended to protect your device, can sometimes go overboard and disrupt normal online functionality.

Now, you have understood the potential causes as the first step toward resolving the issue. Next, we'll guide you through the process of troubleshooting and getting your Vivo X90S back online.

## Part 2: How To Fix “Phone Offline” With Internet Connection Problem

Now that we've figured out why your phone says it's offline, let's tackle the issue head-on. If you're facing problems like downloads that won't start, Google Play stuck on "Loading…," or web pages refusing to load, chances are it's an internet connection issue causing the problem.

Here are some easy solutions to get your connection back.

### Solution 1: Change connection to mobile data

Switching to mobile data can be a quick fix if your Wi-Fi is acting up. It ensures a change in your connection source and might resolve the "Phone offline" issue. Follow these easy steps to change your connection to mobile data:

- **Step 1:** Swipe down from the top of your screen to access the Quick Settings menu.
- **Step 2:** Tap the Wi-Fi icon to turn off the Wi-Fi connection.
- **Step 3:** Tap Mobile Data to turn it on.

![Change connection to mobile data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/why-is-my-phone-offline-2.jpg)

### Solution 2: On and off Airplane mode

[<u>Airplane Mode</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location.html) can sometimes cause connectivity confusion. Turning it off and on essentially resets your phone's wireless connections, which might resolve the offline issue.

How to on and off Airplane mode on Android:

- **Step 1:** Swipe down from the top of your screen to access the Quick Settings menu.
- **Step 2:** Look for the Airplane Mode icon and tap the icon to turn on Airplane Mode.
- **Step 3:** Wait a few seconds, then tap it again to turn off the Airplane Mode. Now, check if your phone is now online.

![On and off the Airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/why-is-my-phone-offline-3.jpg)

### Solution 3: Reset network settings

Resetting network settings can help eliminate any configuration glitches that might be causing the phone offline problem. It's like giving your phone's connection settings a fresh start.

To reset your network settings, the steps may differ depending on the phone model you are using. However, you can generally do so by looking for the “Network” settings.

- **Step 1:** Open your phone's Settings > Connection & sharing.
- **Step 2:** Find and select "Reset Wi-Fi, mobile networks, and Bluetooth.”
- **Step 3:** Tap "Reset Settings" and confirm the action and allow your phone to reset.
- **Step 4:** Reconnect to your Wi-Fi and check if the issue persists.

![Reset the network settings on Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/why-is-my-phone-offline-4.jpg)

### Solution 4: Restart your Wi-Fi router

Sometimes, the problem might not be with your phone but rather with the [<u>Wi-Fi router</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/root/wifi-hacker-without-root.html). Restarting it can refresh the connection and potentially resolve the connectivity problem.

How to restart your Wi-Fi router:

- **Step 1:** Locate your Wi-Fi router.
- **Step 2:** Turn off the router using the power button or unplug it.
- **Step 3:** Wait for about 10–15 seconds before plugging the router back in or turning it on.
- **Step 4:** Allow the router to restart and establish a connection. Then, check if your phone still shows the "Phone Offline" message.

These solutions should cover the most common connectivity issues. If the problem persists, we'll explore further steps in the following sections.

## Part 3: How To Fix “Phone Offline” Despite Having an Internet Connection

Ever found it odd to receive the frustrating offline error message when you're sure your internet connection is up and running? If you've double-checked your internet connection and your phone still says it's offline, the issue may lie within your browser, apps, or device settings.

In this part, we'll answer the question “**Why does My Vivo X90S say offline android?**” despite a seemingly functional internet connection. Then, let's see other solutions on how to get your device back to its online, fully functional self.

### Solution 1: Clear Google Chrome’s cache and data

Sometimes, the answer to “**Why is my Android phone offline**” can be attributed to a buildup of corrupted or outdated data in your browser's cache. Clearing the cache and data for Google Chrome can resolve this issue, allowing for a fresh start and potentially eliminating the offline status.

![Clear Google Chrome’s cache and data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/why-is-my-phone-offline-5.jpg)

### Solution 2: Re-install Google Chrome

If [<u>clearing the cache and data</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/erase-iphone/clear-iphone-cache.html) didn't solve the offline issue, reinstalling Google Chrome can be the next step.

## Part 2. 10 common ways to fix Android won't charge

Charging cables fray or become defunct after prolonged usage. Therefore, it is advised to always use the Vivo X90S device’s original charging cable or purchase a good quality charging cord, which doesn't damage your device or your adapter.

### 2\. Check/clean charging port

The charging port in your device is a small opening where the charging end of the cabbie is inserted for the current to flow to the phone/tablet.
