We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Tecno Spark 10 4G touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Tecno Spark 10 4G Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Tecno Spark 10 4G phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Tecno Spark 10 4G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Tecno Spark 10 4G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Tecno Spark 10 4G device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Tecno Spark 10 4G screens to become unresponsive.

These issues can also occur in any Tecno Spark 10 4G model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Tecno Spark 10 4G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Tecno Spark 10 4G Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Tecno Spark 10 4G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Tecno Spark 10 4G black screen problem.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely
