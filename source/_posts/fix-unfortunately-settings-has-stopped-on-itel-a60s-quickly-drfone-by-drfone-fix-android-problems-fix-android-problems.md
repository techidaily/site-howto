![turn on airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android-1.jpg)

## Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings

The third step you’ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Itel A60s. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.

However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.

1. Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights
2. While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem
3. Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again
4. Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area
5. Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Itel A60s is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data

## Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode

![wifi not working on android - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg)

If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Itel A60s itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.

The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Itel A60s, but the basic process goes as follows;

1. Turn off your Itel A60s by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Itel A60s device is completely off
2. Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time
3. You will see the words ‘Safe Mode’ appear on your screen as the Itel A60s device loads
4. Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works

If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, you’ll know you have a problem with an app or service that’s running on your device. If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.

## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

If you’re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, you’ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Itel A60s itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.

You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.

1. If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Itel A60s device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection
2. If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Itel A60s is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there
3. Whichever method you’re using, try disconnecting your Itel A60s and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Itel A60s needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Itel A60s. Here’s how to check on your Itel A60s to make sure everything is correct.

1. Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Itel A60s
2. Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router
3. Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router
4. Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches

When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.

## Part 7. Fix Android system issues in one click

If none of the solutions above are working, this could indicate a real problem with the firmware and operating system of your Itel A60s. Fortunately, a fast solution to get everything working again is to completely repair the software of your phone.

## Part 8. Check the Wi-Fi connectivity on another phone

![android phone not connecting to wifi - connectivity on another phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

When experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, it’s worth noting the problem might not be with your phone, but rather the Wi-Fi network itself. This is why it’s important to make sure you check the connection on another device.

Of course, if you’re already using another phone on your Wi-Fi network, you know this isn’t the case. However, if you’re not sure, here’s what you need to do;

1. Get another Android or iOS phone or tablet

## Part 9. Change the password of the Wi-Fi

![android phone not connecting to wifi - password settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-password.jpg)

Each Wi-Fi network router will give the opportunity to choose and change the password you have to let devices connect to your network. It’s important you try changing this because you never know if someone else has accessed your network and could be blocking your device. Here’s how it works;

1. Log onto your computer and open your Wi-Fi settings
2. Depending on the brand and method of your individual router, navigate to the Wi-Fi password settings menu
3. Change the password to something complicated using all available digits and characters
4. Save the password and restart the router to disconnect all devices

Here’s how you can do this easily on your Itel A60s;

1. From the home screen of your Itel A60s, open the Settings menu
2. Tap the Backup & Reset option
3. Tap the Reset Network Settings option

A development in arranged availability goes hand-in-hand with the development of cell phones.

Itel A60s smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Itel A60s touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Itel A60s phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen. In this guide, you'll find the information you need to troubleshoot and fix the most common problems reported by Motorola customers.


## **What causes a Itel A60s Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Itel A60s phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Itel A60s device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Itel A60s smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Itel A60s 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

### **There might be issues with the Itel A60s device itself**

Screens on Itel A60s devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every Itel A60s device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.

### **There might be errors in the updated software**

The Android operating system is adjustable. Some of our technological advancements may backfire on us. The phone won't power on or become stuck in a boot loop where the logo will only show intermittently. For example, some Itel A60s 4 and 5 users have reported their screens are unresponsive after a software update, rendering the Itel A60s device unusable.

## **The common solutions to solve a Itel A60s Screen unresponsive**

Could anything be more annoying than a broken touchscreen on your Itel A60s phone? If this happens, the gadget is useless, and you won't be able to do even the simplest tasks. Even so, it's common for the screen to cease responding to touches.

Before taking the item in for repairs, see if you can figure out the problem independently. Do you want to learn the method? If the touch screens on your Itel A60s stop working, don’t panic; we'll teach you exactly what to do.
