- **Step 2:** Go to **Device Maintenance > Storage**or go directly to Storage.

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue. If that’s the case, you can check with your friends if their Spotify is working or check online if Spotify is down. To do that, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.

![search if spotify is down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-20.jpg)

![spotify server up or down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-21.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Go to one or two and see what they say. If Spotify is down, you’ll need to wait for them to fix the problem.

### 11. Clear the Cache

When using different apps and websites, your device caches data from those sources. Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.
