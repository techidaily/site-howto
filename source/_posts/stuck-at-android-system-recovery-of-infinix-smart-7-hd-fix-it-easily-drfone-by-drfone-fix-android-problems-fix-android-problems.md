## Part 2. 10 common ways to fix Android won't charge

### 1\. Check/replace charging cable

Charging cables fray or become defunct after prolonged usage. Therefore, it is advised to always use the Infinix Smart 7 HD device’s original charging cable or purchase a good quality charging cord, which doesn't damage your device or your adapter.

![charging cable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459762305.jpg)

### 2\. Check/clean charging port

The charging port in your device is a small opening where the charging end of the cabbie is inserted for the current to flow to the phone/tablet. Very often, we notice that the charging port gets blocked with tiny particles of dirt. The charging port might also get clogged if dirt and dust get accumulated in it, preventing the sensors from receiving and forwarding the current to the Infinix Smart 7 HD device.

![check charging port](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459938188.jpg)

### 3\. Check/replace charging adapter

This method is fairly simple, and all you need to do is check whether or not the charging adapter is working properly as sometimes, the adapter itself is to be blamed for the charge. To make sure that you are not using a defective adapter, connect your charging cable/USB to another adapter. If your device charges normally, it means there is a problem is with your adapter, and you must replace it at the earliest to solve My Infinix Smart 7 HD won't charge the issue.
