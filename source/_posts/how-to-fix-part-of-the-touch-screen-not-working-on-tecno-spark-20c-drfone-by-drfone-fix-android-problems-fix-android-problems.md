## Top 10 Fixes for Phone Keep Disconnecting from Wi-Fi On Tecno Spark 20C

The revolutionized world is about the internet, online life, and social media. You can get all the information you need from the internet. You are a click away from booking tickets, buying groceries, calling your loved ones, or even you can handle office meetings with the internet.

![fix wifi keep disconnecting android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/why-does-my-phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi.jpg)

Since everything revolves around the internet, it's annoying if your WI-FI disconnects. You might question yourself **why does my Wi-Fi keep disconnecting from the phone**? To know the answer, read the article below.

## Part 1: Why Does Your Phone Keep Disconnecting from WiFi?

Is your phone frequently getting disconnected from Wi-Fi? Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Tecno Spark 20C devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:

- **Router Problems**

If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.

- **Out of Wi-Fi Range**

**Why does My Tecno Spark 20C keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi**? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.

- **Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked**

The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.

- **Devices Connected with Router**

Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.

- **Unstable Internet**

If your Tecno Spark 20C gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.

Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.

## Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone

### Fix 1: Restart Your Phone

### Fix 2: Check Router Settings

If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings.

You should check the Router’s admin panel or app to remove your phone from the blocklist.

![check router settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-2.jpg)

### Fix 3: Reconnect to Network

To fix the annoying problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting, you should try forgetting the network and then reconnecting to it. This could be done easily by following the steps below:

**Step 1**: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.

![tap on your wifi option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg)

**Step 2**: A list of all the Wi-Fi networks will appear on the screen. Select the network that is causing trouble from that list and hit the 'Forget Network' option.

![click on forgot network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-4.jpg)

![enter wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-5.jpg)

### Fix 4: Restart Your Router

As we discussed, to restart your phone, you can also restart the router to get rid of the problem. For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start.

### Fix 5: Forget Old Networks

The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.

**Step 1**: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.

### Fix 6. Check Recently Installed Applications

Sometimes, different installed applications can also cause trouble. If your Wi-Fi was fine, but suddenly it started disconnecting, then don’t forget to check the recently installed apps. This is because with not knowing the damage it can cause, you might have installed some VPNs, connections boosters, or firewalls. You can try and disable them but if that doesn’t resolve the problem, then uninstall the app.

**Step 1**: For uninstalling the problematic application, you have to select it and hold it. You will see a pop-up menu of multiple options; choose the option of ‘Uninstall' to remove the app from the phone.

![tap on ok button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-13.jpg)

### Fix 8: Check Routers Range

If your Wi-Fi automatically disconnects and connects again while you are roaming in the house, then it is because of the router's range; you should check it. For this, you can consider changing and modifying your AP (Access Point) band on your router.

Although the 5GHz frequency band is recognized for providing better network speeds, this band has a shorter range as compared to the 2.4GHz band, which has a better coverage of area. You can easily shift your router’s range through its configuration page. It is considered optimal to utilize the 2.4GHz frequency band for better ranges.

![man holding a bricked phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/how-to-restore-a-bricked-phone-01.jpg)


## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

Below are the common causes why a **cell phone bricks**.

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Tecno Spark 20C device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Tecno Spark 20C device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device's OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. [Rooting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html) often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone's core functionality.

#### Installing Bad Apps

Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation. In severe cases, they can trigger a [boot loop](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/boot-loop-android.html) or render the phone unresponsive.

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.

## Part 2. Unbricking Methods and Tools

Below are solutions that you can employ to fix various brick phone scenarios.
