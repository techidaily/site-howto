If you’re running a custom Android ROM on your device, with some versions of the ROM and some apps, you’re going to experience errors simply because of the way the apps and the ROMs are coded and designed.

Unfortunately, there’s no easy fix to this, and if you want to continue using the app, you’ll need to reflash your Tecno Spark 10 Pro back to its original firmware, and then wait until the ROM developers update the ROM to be compatible with social apps like Snapchat.
