![snapchat stopping - check for android update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-update-firmware.png)

Similar to some of the other solutions we’ve listed above, if you’re using an outdated version of the Android operating system, but the latest version of Snapchat is coded to the most recent, this can be a cause for the Snapchat crashing on Android problem to occur.

Unfortunately, there’s no easy fix to this, and if you want to continue using the app, you’ll need to reflash your Realme GT Neo 5 back to its original firmware, and then wait until the ROM developers update the ROM to be compatible with social apps like Snapchat.
