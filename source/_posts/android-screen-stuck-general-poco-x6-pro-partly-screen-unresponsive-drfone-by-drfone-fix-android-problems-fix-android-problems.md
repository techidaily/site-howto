## Part 1: Understanding Stuck and Dead Poco X6 Pros on Phone Screens

While dead and ****stuck pixels on the phone**** may seem similar, there are important distinctions between the two. Read on to discover the differences and what causes them.

### Stuck Poco X6 Pros on Phone

A ****stuck pixel phone**** is always on, so it shows up on a touchscreen as a bright, persistent dot of red, green, blue, or white. Combinations are also possible, and although it is usually stationary, this dot occasionally flickers.

### Dead Poco X6 Pros on Smartphones

In contrast to the stuck pixel, the dead pixel subpixels are all left unpowered, turning them off. A ****dead pixel on the phone**** is a tiny, persistent rectangle of black or white color on the part of the phone screen not working.

### Some Differences Between Stuck and Dead Poco X6 Pros on Phone

Stuck pixels may have less effect on the user experience than ****dead pixels on the phone**** **screen** since they still display color. But dead pixels may be more disturbing because they are either black or white.

It is easy to mistake stuck and ****dead pixels on the phone**** for one other, but they are unique issues with different causes and effects. Read on to understand the differences and how they affect your phone's display.

These ****broken pixels on the phone**** can hurt the user experience, and it is essential to know the root causes to prevent them from occurring in the first place.

- ****Manufacturing defects****. During manufacturing, some pixels may not work due to poor quality control, resulting in stuck or ****dead pixels on the phone**** In other words, if the power transfer issue isn't completely fixed, you might see more dead pixels.
- ****Physical damage****. Accidents such as dropping the phone or exposure to extreme heat or cold can damage the screen and cause stuck or dead pixels.

![person holding a gadget with pen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-03.jpg)

## Part 2: How To Fix Dead Poco X6 Pros on Phone Screens on Android Devices

### Option 1: Check Phone Screen Appearance

Before attempting to fix a ****dead pixel on a smartphone**** screen, it is necessary to check its appearance and ensure there is no physical damage.

****Step 1:**** Check for chips, cracks, or any other signs of damage on the screen if your ****phone touch screen is not working in some areas****. If you find any damage, you may need to take your phone to a professional repair shop or consider getting a replacement.

![phone with damaged screen from dropping](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-04.jpg)

****Step 2:**** If you have a screen protector or case, remove them because they can interfere with the process. This step will allow you to get a clear view of the screen and accurately assess the ****dead pixel on the phone****.

![smartphone and a screen protector](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-05.jpg)

****Step 3:**** Remove any gloves you may be wearing and any stickers placed over the screen or sensors. Gloves and stickers can interfere with the touchscreen and affect the accuracy of fixing the ****broken pixels on the phone****.

****Step 4:**** Finally, ensure that your screen is clean and free from any smudges or dirt that could affect the accuracy of fixing ****dead pixels on the phone****.

![wiping phone screen with clean cloth](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-06.jpg)

### Option 2: Restart Your Poco X6 Pro

This method may seem simple, but it can be the most effective solution to your problem. Here is how you restart most smartphones available in the market.

****Step 1:**** Press and hold down the ****power key**** on your Poco X6 Pro until the ****power menu**** appears.

****Step 2:**** Select ****Restart**** on your phone's screen. It will initiate a reboot of your device.

![android interface restart and power off](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-07.jpg)

**Tip:**

If your Poco X6 Pro is unresponsive to the usual restart method because a ****part of the phone screen is not working****, try a forced restart by holding the ****power button**** for at least 10 seconds.

### Option 3: Check If Stuck Poco X6 Pro Phone Only Appears in Specific Mobile Apps

If the previous method did not work, check if the ****stuck pixels on the phone**** only appear in specific mobile apps. Sometimes, stuck pixels may only show up when using particular apps, so identifying which app is causing the issue can help pinpoint the problem.

****Step 1:**** Put your smartphone in ****Safe Mode****.

**Note:**

Visit the help page for your device's manufacturer to learn how to activate and deactivate safe mode. Safe mode disables all downloaded programs momentarily.

![safe mode on the android screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-08.jpg)

****Step 2:**** Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the ****stuck pixel phone**** display. Next, turn off ****Safe Mode****.

****Step 3:**** To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.

### Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset

Consider a factory data reset if the previous options did not resolve your issue with stuck or dead pixels on the phone screen. This process will erase all data from your device, so remember to back up any important information before proceeding.

****Step 1:**** Open the ****Settings**** application.

**Step 2:** Choose ****System > Reset > Erase all data (factory reset) > Erase all data****.

![smartphone reset settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-09.jpg)

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

Aside from the methods and tools discussed for fixing ****dead pixels on phone screen****s and ****stuck pixels on the phone****, you may still have some questions regarding the issues. Whether you are dealing with a single stuck pixel or a cluster of dead pixels, this section aims to provide you with helpful insights.

### 1\. Can Dead Poco X6 Pros Fix Themselves?

No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Poco X6 Pros Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

### 3\. Why Are Dead Poco X6 Pros Spreading on My Poco X6 Pro?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Poco X6 Pros Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Poco X6 Pro devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.
