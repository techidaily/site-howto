### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending.

### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.

### Update Gmail App

As the last tip that will indeed help you is to update the Gmail app. Until you update the app when required, Gmail keeps stopping you from working and you will definitely get frustrated. Therefore, go to Play Store and look for the Gmail update. If it is available, welcome it with smile and bid farewell to the problem of slow running Gmail.

### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 1: Head to the “Settings” of your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G and then opt for “Wireless and Networks” followed by “WLAN/WiFi”.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".
