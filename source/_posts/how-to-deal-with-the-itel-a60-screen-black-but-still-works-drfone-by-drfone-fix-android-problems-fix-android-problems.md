## Part 1: Why Did My Itel A60 Screen Go Black but Still Works? Common Causes

Experiencing a **cell phone blank screen** is not exclusive to Android or iOS users. A **phone screen not turning on** happens all the time due to several factors that may or may not be out of your control. While they can be frustrating, here are some common causes you should know as to why **your phone screen went black but still works.**

### A Drained Battery

The first thing that comes to mind when your **phone screen suddenly goes black** is you have a drained battery. Even though this is obvious, it’s still important to mention, as this is usually what most people encounter. To fix this problem, plug your smartphone into a charger and wait for your device to turn on again. If it works, then you just prevented a rather annoying experience.

### App Troubles

If your **phone is working, but the screen is black,** there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application. An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.

### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software. This problem suggests that your Itel A60 is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately. If this is the cause, then your device is likely experiencing a critical system error, and you should directly try to reboot your phone.

### Hardware Problem

If you dropped your phone, there’s a high chance the LCD connectors went loose due to the physical impact. If this happened to you, the phone might be working, but the screen is black due to the LCD cable dislodging. Another issue could be your phone got exposed to extreme temperatures. This can also cause a **black screen but your phone is still on.**

While Itel A60 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Itel A60 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Itel A60, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Itel A60 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Itel A60 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Itel A60 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Itel A60 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Itel A60 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Itel A60 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Itel A60 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Itel A60 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent Itel A60 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Itel A60 device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid Itel A60 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Itel A60 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Itel A60 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Itel A60 App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Itel A60 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data.

## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Itel A60 device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Itel A60 device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Itel A60 freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.

### Common Reasons for Your Itel A60 Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Itel A60 devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Itel A60 device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.
