While Itel P55T devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Itel P55T device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Itel P55T, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Itel P55T device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Itel P55T F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Itel P55T device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Itel P55T device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Itel P55T device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Itel P55T App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Itel P55T Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data.
