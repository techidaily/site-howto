### Ensure to Use Gmail Supported Browser

First of all, you need to make sure that the browser you are using works with Gmail or not. Gmail can smoothly perform in Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. However, the browsers should be updated. So, please make sure that these browsers are running on the latest versions. Moreover, in case you use Chromebook, don’t forget to update the operating system in order to let it support Gmail.

### Clear Cache of web browser

If you tried the above method but to no avail, try to clear the cache and cookies of the web browser. But by doing so, the browser history will be removed. As well as, the records of the websites you previously enjoyed will also be lost.

Now, here is another annoying problem that doesn’t let Gmail working on Android properly. This problem addresses the situation where users send a mail but it gets stuck on sending. If this is the problem that you are going through, the following solutions will help you.

### Try Alternative Gmail Address

### Check Network Connection

As already mentioned, be sure of an active internet connection while working with Gmail. When you are not using a stable connection, it may lead to stuck on sending, Gmail crashing and many other issues. You can fix the issue by doing these three things:

1. Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.
2. Turn off Wi-Fi and then turn it on again after nearly 5 seconds. Do the same with the router. Plug it out and the plug in.
3. Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.

Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.

### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending. If these are not so important, you can remove them and send the mail. Or if it is not possible to send the mail without attachments, compressing the files can be a solution.

## Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue

### Restart the Phone

## Reliable User Guide to Fix Tecno Camon 20 Running Slow and Freezing

Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.

However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the **Android phone is running slow and freezing** over time. There can be many potential reasons why **Android phone runs slow** suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.

In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Tecno Camon 20 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Tecno Camon 20 device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Tecno Camon 20 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Tecno Camon 20 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Tecno Camon 20 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Tecno Camon 20 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Tecno Camon 20 is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Tecno Camon 20 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Tecno Camon 20s.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Tecno Camon 20 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Tecno Camon 20 device. So if your Tecno Camon 20 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Tecno Camon 20 device’s animation type and speed on your Tecno Camon 20 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Tecno Camon 20 to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Tecno Camon 20 is running slow and freezing, the Tecno Camon 20 device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues
