So, if your **Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G black screen problem.

To restart a Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5Glogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely
