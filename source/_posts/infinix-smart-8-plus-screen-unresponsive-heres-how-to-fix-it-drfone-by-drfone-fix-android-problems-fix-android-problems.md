### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Infinix Smart 8 Plus black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

To restart a Infinix Smart 8 Plus device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Infinix Smart 8 Pluslogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Leaving the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service
