Why can’t you take a screenshot of something on your phone and get the error message that says, “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**”? Apps and websites turn off or remove the screenshot feature for a variety of reasons, including:

Some apps and websites, such as banking apps, store private data like financial and credit card details. Blocking capturing screenshots is a way to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information.

Follow Regulations

Some industries and organizations have regulations that need them to protect sensitive data. Financial institutions must protect their customers’ financial information, for example. Disabling screenshots is one way to follow these regulations.
