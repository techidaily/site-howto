### 2. Pull Out Battery

Another way to restart your Lava Blaze 2 Pro when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page.

If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Lava Blaze 2 Pro to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.

### 4. Wipe Cache Data

This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Lava Blaze 2 Pro device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Lava Blaze 2 Pro to become slower and eventually get stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

Wiping out the cache data from your Lava Blaze 2 Pro could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.

If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset.
