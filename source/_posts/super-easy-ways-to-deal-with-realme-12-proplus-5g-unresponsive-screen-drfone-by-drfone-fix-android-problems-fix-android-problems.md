You’ve probably seen this error message before, especially when taking screenshots of banking or video streaming apps. But why do apps and websites block screenshots? It’s actually for your good.

Screenshots can be misused to steal money or pirate copyrighted content. By prohibiting screenshots, apps and websites can help to protect your data and privacy.

Why can’t you take a screenshot of something on your phone and get the error message that says, “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**”? Apps and websites turn off or remove the screenshot feature for a variety of reasons, including:

Follow Regulations

Some industries and organizations have regulations that need them to protect sensitive data. Financial institutions must protect their customers’ financial information, for example. Disabling screenshots is one way to follow these regulations.

DRM-Protected Content

**Android can’t take screenshots due to security policy**, especially to prevent piracy. Piracy is the distribution of copyrighted material without permission. It can harm businesses that depend on copyright protection.

To prevent this, you can use DRM (digital rights management) to protect copyrighted content. DRM-protected content cannot be screenshotted or copied.

Prevent Fraud

Scammers and other criminals often use screenshots to commit fraud. For instance, people might send fake screenshots to trick others into sharing personal details or money. Disabling screenshots can help to prevent this type of fraud.

Protect User Privacy

Some apps and websites allow users to share private information. Some apps, like messaging apps, let users share private info. But there are limits.
