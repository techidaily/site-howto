## Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot

![android not receiving texts - free up space](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg)

## Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App

### 2. Pull Out Battery

Another way to restart your Xiaomi Redmi K70 when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page.

If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Xiaomi Redmi K70 to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.
