- **Step 1:** Turn off your smartphone and enter recovery mode by pressing the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously. Different devices have various approaches for entering recovery mode, so you may perform better.

- **Step 2:** Click the **“Install zip from sdcard”** button. Then, select the ZIP file that contains the ROM. Finally, click the **"reboot system now"** button.
