While they can be frustrating, here are some common causes you should know as to why **your phone screen went black but still works.**

### A Drained Battery

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Realme GT Neo 5 black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Realme GT Neo 5's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Realme GT Neo 5 device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem.

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

After fully discharging the battery, the Realme GT Neo 5 device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Realme GT Neo 5 device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Realme GT Neo 5 device in for repair or replacement.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Realme GT Neo 5 Y2 and Realme GT Neo 5 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Realme GT Neo 5 device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

![clear cached data on xiaomi 5a](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/clear-cached-data-on-xiaomi5a.png)

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Realme GT Neo 5 device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Realme GT Neo 5 device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness.
