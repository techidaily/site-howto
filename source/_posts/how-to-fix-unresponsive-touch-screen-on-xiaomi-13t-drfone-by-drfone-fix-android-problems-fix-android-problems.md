## How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Xiaomi 13T

With the increase in our reliance on smartphones, having **touchscreen problems** on your device can be annoying. Sometimes, it’s even more frustrating than a physically broken screen because you don’t know where the issue is coming from.

If your **touchscreen is malfunctioning** or doesn’t work correctly, you cannot interact with your device. On this page, you’ll learn general **phone touch problems** on Android and how to get rid of them. Now explore the article to learn more.

![android screen problems intro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Is My Android Experiencing Touch Screen Problems

Below are some of the most common reasons you’re experiencing touch problems on your Android smartphone.

- The **touchscreen problem**freezes your phone, lags, or hangs.
- Some parts of the screen work fine, but some don’t.
- Your screen responds inaccurately (typing “a” gets you “q” or “z”).
- The touchscreen is automatically operating itself, resulting in ghost touch.
- It doesn’t respond to any taps, and the phone’s screen has stopped working.
- The device is physically damaged, or the screen is cracked or broken.
- Outdated devices are prone to the black/white/blue screen of death.

## Part 2: Tips, Fixes, and Workarounds To Fix Your Xiaomi 13T Touch Problems

If any of the outlined reasons above are the cause of your **touch screen malfunctioning,** here are some solutions to fix it.

### Method 1: Remove the Screen Protector and Phone Case

Some phone cases and screen protectors cause **touch problems** on your Android screen. This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.

![android remove screen protector](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg)

### Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone

A **touchscreen malfunctioning** can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.

![android dirty screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg)

### Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While

**Touch problems** also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.

### Method 4: Restart Your Android

Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a **touchscreen problem** on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.

![android restart method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg)

To restart your Android, press and hold the **Power** button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the **Power** button as well as the **Volume Down** button at the same time.

### Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android

Before attempting to have your device checked for any hardware defects, you should try completing a Factory Reset. To do this, go to **Settings > Backup and Reset.** Next, tap on **Factory data reset** \> **Delete all**.

![android factory data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg)

Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.

### Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode

If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.

**Note**

Placing your Android into **Recovery Mode** is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Xiaomi 13T.

**Step 1A**: Press and hold the **Power** button and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.

**Step 1B**: If your Xiaomi 13T still has a **Home** button, press and hold the **Home** button and the **Power** button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.

**Step 1C**: If step 1A did not put your Android into **Recovery Mode**, press and hold the **Power** and **Volume Up** and **Down** buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.

![android recovery mode 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg)

**Step 2**: Use the **Volume** buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data/factory reset, and confirm your choice with the **Power** button.

![android recovery mode 02](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg)

**Step 3**: Wait for the process to complete and for your Xiaomi 13T to restart automatically.

### Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen

If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the **touchscreen problem,** it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Xiaomi 13T checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.

![图像](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-08.jpg)"

### Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center

Your **phone touch problem** might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced. If your Android is still unresponsive, it’s best to bring your smartphone to an authorized service center or directly to the phone manufacturer, especially when all efforts are exhausted.

## Part 5. Check for the Android update

![snapchat stopping - check for android update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-update-firmware.png)

Similar to some of the other solutions we’ve listed above, if you’re using an outdated version of the Android operating system, but the latest version of Snapchat is coded to the most recent, this can be a cause for the Snapchat crashing on Android problem to occur.

Fortunately, it’s easy to check to make sure you’re running the latest version of Android and to download and install the update if you need it. Here’s how, which will help to sort out your Snapchat keeps crashing Android problems.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Xiaomi 13T and select the About Phone option.

**Step 2:** Tap the ‘Check for Updates’ option. If an update is available, you’ll then have the option to Install Now or Install Overnight. If no update is available, you’ll see a notification stating your device is up to date and no action is needed.

## Part 6. Connect to another Wi-Fi

In some cases, you may be trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network that’s not very stable. This may keep cutting the connection to your device, which in turn is causing Snapchat to crash on Android.

To resolve this, you can simply try connecting to another Wi-Fi network or a data plan to see whether this is the problem. If so, changing network and then using the Snapchat app should stop any error messages from occurring.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Xiaomi 13T, followed by the Wi-Fi option.

## Part 7. Stop using the custom ROM

If you’re running a custom Android ROM on your device, with some versions of the ROM and some apps, you’re going to experience errors simply because of the way the apps and the ROMs are coded and designed.

Unfortunately, there’s no easy fix to this, and if you want to continue using the app, you’ll need to reflash your Xiaomi 13T back to its original firmware, and then wait until the ROM developers update the ROM to be compatible with social apps like Snapchat.

However, this reflashing process is simple thanks to the Dr.Fone - System Repair (Android) software that we listed above. To follow the detailed step-by-step guide, follow the steps on Part 4 of this article, or follow the quick guide instructions below.

## Part 8. Reset the factory settings of your Android

![snapchat stopping - factory resetting](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-factory-reset.jpg)

One of the last resorts you can take is factory resetting your Xiaomi 13T back to its original settings. From the day you first started using your device, you’ve been using the system and downloading files and apps, and over time this increases the chances of creating a bug.

However, by resetting your device to factory settings, you can reset these bugs and get your apps and device working again free from the Unfortunately, Snapchat has stopped error message. Here’s how to factory reset your device.

Make sure you back up your personal files from your device first like your photos and music files because factory resetting your device will clear your device’s memory.

**Step 1:** Tap the Settings menu on your device and click the Backup and Reset option.

**Step 2:** Click the Reset Phone option. That’s it! The phone will take several minutes to complete the process, after which your phone will be reset to its original state.
