## Xiaomi 13T Screen Unresponsive? Here's How to Fix It

Xiaomi 13T phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Xiaomi 13T touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Xiaomi 13T phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Xiaomi 13T touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Xiaomi 13T Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Xiaomi 13T phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Xiaomi 13T screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Xiaomi 13T Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Xiaomi 13T device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Xiaomi 13T screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Xiaomi 13T model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Xiaomi 13T Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Xiaomi 13T Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Xiaomi 13T screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Xiaomi 13T model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Xiaomi 13T black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Xiaomi 13T's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Xiaomi 13T device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Xiaomi 13T device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Xiaomi 13Tlogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Xiaomi 13T device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Xiaomi 13T device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Xiaomi 13T device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Xiaomi 13T device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Xiaomi 13T device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Xiaomi 13T Y2 and Xiaomi 13T 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Xiaomi 13T device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.
