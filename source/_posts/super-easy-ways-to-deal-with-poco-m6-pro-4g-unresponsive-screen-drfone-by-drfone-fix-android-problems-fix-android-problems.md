A development in arranged availability goes hand-in-hand with the development of cell phones.

Poco M6 Pro 4G smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Poco M6 Pro 4G touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Poco M6 Pro 4G phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen. In this guide, you'll find the information you need to troubleshoot and fix the most common problems reported by Motorola customers.


## **What causes a Poco M6 Pro 4G Screen to be unresponsive?**

### **There are signs of soft bricking**
