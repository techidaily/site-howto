That may also occur when there is a technical failure, such as the phone hanging. A ****part of the touch screen not working**** can occur when malware is downloaded or when phone settings are changed.

Now, the problem can affect any Android phone, and users may encounter the following error messages on their respective phone models:

- Nexus touch screen not working
- LG screen is unresponsive to touch
- Vivo Y17s ****left side of the screen is not working****

- Your touches do not register on the touch screen.
- The touch screen incorrectly responds to your touch.
- ****Half touch screen is not working****.
- The touch screen becomes frozen or hangs.
- The screen flashes, flickers, or remains blank.
- The****left side of the phone screen is not working****.

Before proceeding to how to fix an unresponsive touch screen on an Android device, you should complete the following steps:

- If the screen is damaged, it must be replaced.
- Remove the Vivo Y17s device cover and screen protector if they are not damaged.
- If there is a sticker on the Vivo Y17s device screen, you must remove it.
- Before continuing, make sure your screen is spotless.

## Part 3. How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working (No Physical Damage)

If you have already tried running the Vivo Y17s device in diagnostic mode and verified that it is not physically damaged, then the problem is most likely technical. If your Vivo Y17s’s screen is not responding to touches for technical reasons, follow the methods below to resolve the issue.

### Restart Your Device

When your touch screen stops working, the first thing you should do is restart your device. The operation is known as soft resetting. You cannot turn your device off from the option on the screen because the touch screen is not responding. Here are the steps to take.

****Step 1:**** Hold the “Power” button until the Vivo Y17s device turns off.

**Tip:** If you hold down the power button for a few seconds, you will see the “Power Off” and “Restart” options on the screen. You can’t use it because the entire screen isn’t responding. Hence, you should press and hold the “Power” button for as long as necessary.

![restart android with power button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-1.JPG)

****Step 2:**** When the Vivo Y17s device turns off, wait a few seconds.

****Step 3:**** Press and hold the “Power” button to restart the Vivo Y17s device.

Check to see if the Android auto touch screen is not working problem has been resolved. Otherwise, proceed with the following methods.

### Turn On Safe Mode

You should switch to Safe mode whenever an application or piece of software causes a problem on your device. Only the most fundamental system components are loaded and used when operating in Safe mode.

If your touch screen is functional in safe mode, the issue is most likely internal. You can quickly fix the Android touchscreen issue by following the prompts given below to activate the safe mode:

****Step 1:**** To force a restart, press and hold the Vivo Y17s device’s “Power” button for an extended period.

****Step 2:**** Maintain pressure on the “Power” button. Take your finger off it once you see the manufacturer’s logo.

****Step 3:**** When you let go of the “Power” button, press and hold the “Volume Down” button. After that, a “Safe Mode” label will appear in your screen’s lower-left corner.

### Turn Off Developer Options

Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.

If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:

****Step 1:**** Launch the ****Settings**** app on your device.

****Step 2:**** Select the ****System**** menu item, which usually locates at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3:** Tap the Advanced options menu, then select Developer Options.

****Step 4:**** You will then find the switch to turn it on or off. Disable itby toggling the button off.

****Step 5:**** Restart your device to check if the part of the touch screen not working issue has been resolved.

### Reset Device to Factory Settings

Resetting your device to its factory settings will return it to its state when you first unboxed it. All your phone’s data and installed apps will be erased, including any malware on your device that may be causing the issue to occur. Here’s how to restore your device to factory settings:

****Step 1:**** Since your touch screen is not working, you can factory reset it using Google’s Find My Device web service.

****Step 2:**** Go to **Find My Device** from any d****evice**** and sign in to the Google account associated with the damaged screen device.

****Step 3:**** After successfully logging in, you will see your device’s name. Select the ****Erase Device**** option.

A **bricked cell phone** also involves potential data erasure. Yet, it's crucial to understand the true implications of a **bricked phone**.

![man holding a bricked phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/how-to-restore-a-bricked-phone-01.jpg)


## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

Below are the common causes why a **cell phone bricks**.

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Vivo Y17s device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Vivo Y17s device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device's OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. [Rooting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html) often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone's core functionality.

#### Installing Bad Apps

Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation. In severe cases, they can trigger a [boot loop](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/boot-loop-android.html) or render the phone unresponsive.

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.

## Part 2. Unbricking Methods and Tools

Below are solutions that you can employ to fix various brick phone scenarios.

### Seek Professional Assistance (Hard Brick and Soft Brick)

When your phone falls outside the warranty coverage, consider seeking help from a reputable repair shop. However, be aware that any lost data cannot be attributed to their efforts. Fortunately, you can recover lost data using reliable data recovery software once your phone is operational again.
