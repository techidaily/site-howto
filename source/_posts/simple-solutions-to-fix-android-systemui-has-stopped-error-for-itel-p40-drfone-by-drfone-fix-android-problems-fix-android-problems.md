While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Itel P40 model.

### 1. Restart The Device

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Itel P40 black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Itel P40's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Itel P40 device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Itel P40 device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Itel P40logo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Itel P40 device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Itel P40 device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Itel P40 device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

If restarting the Itel P40 device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Itel P40 device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Itel P40 Y2 and Itel P40 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Itel P40 device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

You can clear your cached data using the default settings.

- Select **Settings**\> **Storage** > **Cached Data**.
- To clear the cache, select **Clear Cache**.

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Itel P40 device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Itel P40 device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Itel P40 device, so it should only be considered a last resort.

In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Itel P40 Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.

- Open the **Settings**.
