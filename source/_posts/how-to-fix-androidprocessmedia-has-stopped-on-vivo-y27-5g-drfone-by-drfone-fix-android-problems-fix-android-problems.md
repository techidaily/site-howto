There are several reasons why a Vivo Y27 5G phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Vivo Y27 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.
