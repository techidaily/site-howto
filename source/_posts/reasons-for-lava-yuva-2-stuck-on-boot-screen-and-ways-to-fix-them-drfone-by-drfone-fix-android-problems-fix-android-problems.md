### 1. Changes to the Software

Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the ****Android boot screen****.

Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.

Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an ****Android phone stuck on the logo**** page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.

### 2. Android Software Updates

Updates are a common cause of ****Android phones stuck on the logo****. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen**** and many others might occur.

Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.

When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Lava Yuva 2 has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your ****Android phone getting stuck on the logo****.

### 3. Malfunctioning Applications

If you noticed that your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.

## Part 2. 10 common ways to fix Android won't charge

### 2\. Check/clean charging port

The charging port in your device is a small opening where the charging end of the cabbie is inserted for the current to flow to the phone/tablet. Very often, we notice that the charging port gets blocked with tiny particles of dirt.

### 3\. Check/replace charging adapter

To make sure that you are not using a defective adapter, connect your charging cable/USB to another adapter. If your device charges normally, it means there is a problem is with your adapter, and you must replace it at the earliest to solve My Lava Yuva 2 won't charge the issue.
