Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Nokia 105 Classic device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Nokia 105 Classic, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Nokia 105 Classic device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Nokia 105 Classic F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Nokia 105 Classic device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Nokia 105 Classic Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Nokia 105 Classic device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Nokia 105 Classic device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
