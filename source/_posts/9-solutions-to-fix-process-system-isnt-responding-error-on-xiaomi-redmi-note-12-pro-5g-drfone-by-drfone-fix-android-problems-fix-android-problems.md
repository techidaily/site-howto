## Part 1: Why Does My Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G Say Offline?

When you encounter the “offline” error message, it can disrupt your usual smartphone activities. Suddenly, you find yourself unable to browse the internet, send or receive emails, or stay connected through instant messages.

It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

2. **Internet connection issues**

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.

3. **Glitches or bugs**

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

4. **Firewall restrictions**

In some cases, a firewall on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G might be overly restrictive, preventing the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G device from establishing a connection to the internet. This security measure, intended to protect your device, can sometimes go overboard and disrupt normal online functionality.

Now, you have understood the potential causes as the first step toward resolving the issue. Next, we'll guide you through the process of troubleshooting and getting your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G back online.
