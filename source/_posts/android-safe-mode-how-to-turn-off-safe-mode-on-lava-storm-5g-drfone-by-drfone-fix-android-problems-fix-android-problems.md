## Part 2: Clear the Android phone’s RAM and retry

    Note: Please note that different devices have different ways to go to the Recent apps screen. Do it according to the Lava Storm 5G device you own.

1. Open “Settings” on your Android and tap on “Application manager” or “Apps” or “Application.
2. Now, head to all the apps and select “Google Play Store” from there.
