This can happen to various models, such as the OnePlus Nord N30 SE, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an OnePlus Nord N30 SE device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the OnePlus Nord N30 SE F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an OnePlus Nord N30 SE device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the OnePlus Nord N30 SE Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
