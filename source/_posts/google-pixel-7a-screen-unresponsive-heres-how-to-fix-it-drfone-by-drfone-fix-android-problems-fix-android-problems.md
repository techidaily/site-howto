## Google Pixel 7a Screen Unresponsive? Here's How to Fix It

Google Pixel 7a phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Google Pixel 7a touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Google Pixel 7a phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Google Pixel 7a touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Google Pixel 7a Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Google Pixel 7a phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Google Pixel 7a screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Google Pixel 7a Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Google Pixel 7a device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Google Pixel 7a screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Google Pixel 7a model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Google Pixel 7a Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Google Pixel 7a Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Google Pixel 7a screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Google Pixel 7a model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Google Pixel 7a black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Google Pixel 7a's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Google Pixel 7a device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Google Pixel 7a device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Google Pixel 7alogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Google Pixel 7a device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Google Pixel 7a device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Google Pixel 7a device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Google Pixel 7a device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Google Pixel 7a device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Google Pixel 7a Y2 and Google Pixel 7a 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Google Pixel 7a device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Google Pixel 7a device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Google Pixel 7a device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Google Pixel 7a device, so it should only be considered a last resort.

In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Google Pixel 7a Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.
