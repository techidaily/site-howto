Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. **Vivo Y78+ Android System WebView crashing apps** can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.

It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Vivo Y78+ showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Vivo Y78+.
