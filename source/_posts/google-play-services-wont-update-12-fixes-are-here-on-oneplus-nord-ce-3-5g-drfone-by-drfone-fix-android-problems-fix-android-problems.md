## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G. Here’s how to check on your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G to make sure everything is correct.

When experiencing problems with your Wi-Fi network, it’s worth noting the problem might not be with your phone, but rather the Wi-Fi network itself. This is why it’s important to make sure you check the connection on another device.

1. Get another Android or iOS phone or tablet
