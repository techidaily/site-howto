This should solve the problem. If not, move on to the other techniques.

#### **2.4 Check APK File**

An incomplete and irregular App installation may cause the .apk file to get corrupted. Make sure you download the file completely. If need be, delete the existing App or its .apk file and reinstall it from Google Play Store for it to be compatible with your device’s software and to use the App smoothly.

#### **2.5 Check App Manifest File**

Manifested App files are nothing but .apk files which are improvised by you. Such changes may cause the Parse Error to occur more frequently. Modifications in the App file can be made by changing its name, App settings, or more advanced customizations. Make sure you roll back all changes and restore the App file to its original state to prevent it from getting corrupted.

#### **2.6 Disable Antivirus and other cleaner Apps**

Antivirus software and other cleaning Apps are very helpful in blocking unwanted and harmful Apps from damaging your device. However, sometimes such Apps also prevent you from using other safe Apps.

We do not suggest that you delete the Antivirus App permanently. Temporary uninstallation will be useful here. To do so:

• Visit “Settings” and then select “Apps”.

• Select the antivirus App to click on “Uninstall” and then tap “OK”.
